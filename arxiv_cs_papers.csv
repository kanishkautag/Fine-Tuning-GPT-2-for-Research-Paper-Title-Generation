"The unknotting number, hard unknot diagrams, and reinforcement learning","We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown."
"Agents in Software Engineering: Survey, Landscape, and Vision","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges. We maintain a GitHub repository of the related papers at: https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/Awesome-Agent4SE."
Towards Leveraging Contrastively Pretrained Neural Audio Embeddings for Recommender Tasks,"Music recommender systems frequently utilize network-based models to capture relationships between music pieces, artists, and users. Although these relationships provide valuable insights for predictions, new music pieces or artists often face the cold-start problem due to insufficient initial information. To address this, one can extract content-based information directly from the music to enhance collaborative-filtering-based methods. While previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted audio features for this purpose, we explore the use of contrastively pretrained neural audio embedding models, which offer a richer and more nuanced representation of music. Our experiments demonstrate that neural embeddings, particularly those generated with the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model, present a promising approach to enhancing music recommendation tasks within graph-based frameworks."
INN-PAR: Invertible Neural Network for PPG to ABP Reconstruction,"Non-invasive and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for the early prevention of many cardiovascular diseases. Estimating arterial blood pressure (ABP) from photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing deep learning approaches for PPG-to-ABP reconstruction (PAR) encounter certain information loss, impacting the precision of the reconstructed signal. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an invertible neural network for PPG to ABP reconstruction (INN-PAR), which employs a series of invertible blocks to jointly learn the mapping between PPG and its gradient with the ABP signal and its gradient. INN-PAR efficiently captures both forward and inverse mappings simultaneously, thereby preventing information loss. By integrating signal gradients into the learning process, INN-PAR enhances the network's ability to capture essential high-frequency details, leading to more accurate signal reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a multi-scale convolution module (MSCM) within the invertible block, enabling the model to learn features across multiple scales effectively. We have experimented on two benchmark datasets, which show that INN-PAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both waveform reconstruction and BP measurement accuracy."
An Efficient and Streaming Audio Visual Active Speaker Detection System,"This paper delves into the challenging task of Active Speaker Detection (ASD), where the system needs to determine in real-time whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. While previous works have made significant strides in improving network architectures and learning effective representations for ASD, a critical gap exists in the exploration of real-time system deployment. Existing models often suffer from high latency and memory usage, rendering them impractical for immediate applications. To bridge this gap, we present two scenarios that address the key challenges posed by real-time constraints. First, we introduce a method to limit the number of future context frames utilized by the ASD model. By doing so, we alleviate the need for processing the entire sequence of future frames before a decision is made, significantly reducing latency. Second, we propose a more stringent constraint that limits the total number of past frames the model can access during inference. This tackles the persistent memory issues associated with running streaming ASD systems. Beyond these theoretical frameworks, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate that constrained transformer models can achieve performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art recurrent models, such as uni-directional GRUs, with a significantly reduced number of context frames. Moreover, we shed light on the temporal memory requirements of ASD systems, revealing that larger past context has a more profound impact on accuracy than future context. When profiling on a CPU we find that our efficient architecture is memory bound by the amount of past context it can use and that the compute cost is negligible as compared to the memory cost."
Closed-Loop Visuomotor Control with Generative Expectation for Robotic Manipulation,"Despite significant progress in robotics and embodied AI in recent years, deploying robots for long-horizon tasks remains a great challenge. Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts. Code and checkpoints are maintained at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/CLOVER."
AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents,"To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents."
The Better Solution Probability Metric: Optimizing QAOA to Outperform its Warm-Start Solution,"This paper presents a numerical simulation investigation of the Warm-Start Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as proposed by Tate et al. [1], focusing on its application to 3-regular Max-Cut problems. Our study demonstrates that Warm-Start QAOA consistently outperforms theoretical lower bounds on approximation ratios across various tilt angles, highlighting its potential in practical scenarios beyond worst-case predictions. Despite these improvements, Warm-Start QAOA with traditional parameters optimized for expectation value does not exceed the performance of the initial classical solution. To address this, we introduce an alternative parameter optimization objective, the Better Solution Probability (BSP) metric. Our results show that BSP-optimized Warm-Start QAOA identifies solutions at non-trivial tilt angles that are better than even the best classically found warm-start solutions with non-vanishing probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of both theoretical and empirical analyses in refining QAOA and exploring its potential for quantum advantage."
VAE Explainer: Supplement Learning Variational Autoencoders with Interactive Visualization,"Variational Autoencoders are widespread in Machine Learning, but are typically explained with dense math notation or static code examples. This paper presents VAE Explainer, an interactive Variational Autoencoder running in the browser to supplement existing static documentation (e.g., Keras Code Examples). VAE Explainer adds interactions to the VAE summary with interactive model inputs, latent space, and output. VAE Explainer connects the high-level understanding with the implementation: annotated code and a live computational graph. The VAE Explainer interactive visualization is live at https://xnought.github.io/vae-explainer and the code is open source at https://github.com/xnought/vae-explainer."
Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering,"Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper."
Optimizing Rare Word Accuracy in Direct Speech Translation with a Retrieval-and-Demonstration Approach,"Direct speech translation (ST) models often struggle with rare words. Incorrect translation of these words can have severe consequences, impacting translation quality and user trust. While rare word translation is inherently challenging for neural models due to sparse learning signals, real-world scenarios often allow access to translations of past recordings on similar topics. To leverage these valuable resources, we propose a retrieval-and-demonstration approach to enhance rare word translation accuracy in direct ST models. First, we adapt existing ST models to incorporate retrieved examples for rare word translation, which allows the model to benefit from prepended examples, similar to in-context learning. We then develop a cross-modal (speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-text) retriever to locate suitable examples. We demonstrate that standard ST models can be effectively adapted to leverage examples for rare word translation, improving rare word translation accuracy over the baseline by 17.6% with gold examples and 8.5% with retrieved examples. Moreover, our speech-to-speech retrieval approach outperforms other modalities and exhibits higher robustness to unseen speakers. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/SiqiLii/Retrieve-and-Demonstration-ST)."
SGFormer: Single-Layer Graph Transformers with Approximation-Free Linear Complexity,"Learning representations on large graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature. Transformers recently have shown promising performance on small graphs thanks to its global attention for capturing all-pair interactions beyond observed structures. Existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated architectures by stacking deep attention-based propagation layers. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the necessity of adopting multi-layer attentions in Transformers on graphs, which considerably restricts the efficiency. Specifically, we analyze a generic hybrid propagation layer, comprised of all-pair attention and graph-based propagation, and show that multi-layer propagation can be reduced to one-layer propagation, with the same capability for representation learning. It suggests a new technical path for building powerful and efficient Transformers on graphs, particularly through simplifying model architectures without sacrificing expressiveness. As exemplified by this work, we propose a Simplified Single-layer Graph Transformers (SGFormer), whose main component is a single-layer global attention that scales linearly w.r.t. graph sizes and requires none of any approximation for accommodating all-pair interactions. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M, yielding orders-of-magnitude inference acceleration over peer Transformers on medium-sized graphs, and demonstrates competitiveness with limited labeled data."
Turbo Equalization with Coarse Quantization using the Information Bottleneck Method,"This paper proposes a turbo equalizer for intersymbol interference channels (ISI) that uses coarsely quantized messages across all receiver components. Lookup tables (LUTs) carry out compression operations designed with the information bottleneck method aiming to maximize relevant mutual information. The turbo setup consists of an equalizer and a decoder that provide extrinsic information to each other over multiple turbo iterations. We develop simplified LUT structures to incorporate the decoder feedback in the equalizer with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed receiver is optimized for selected ISI channels. A conceptual hardware implementation is developed to compare the area efficiency and error correction performance. A thorough analysis reveals that LUT-based configurations with very coarse quantization can achieve higher area efficiency than conventional equalizers. Moreover, the proposed turbo setups can outperform the respective non-turbo setups regarding area efficiency and error correction capability."
Model-independent variable selection via the rule-based variable priorit,"While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics, and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification, and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show, among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection."
"E2MoCase: A Dataset for Emotional, Event and Moral Observations in News Articles on High-impact Legal Cases","The way media reports on legal cases can significantly shape public opinion, often embedding subtle biases that influence societal views on justice and morality. Analyzing these biases requires a holistic approach that captures the emotional tone, moral framing, and specific events within the narratives. In this work we introduce E2MoCase, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the integrated analysis of emotions, moral values, and events within legal narratives and media coverage. By leveraging advanced models for emotion detection, moral value identification, and event extraction, E2MoCase offers a multi-dimensional perspective on how legal cases are portrayed in news articles."
Biomimetic Frontend for Differentiable Audio Processing,"While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential applications."
Mechanism Design for Extending the Accessibility of Facilities,"We study a variation of facility location problems (FLPs) that aims to improve the accessibility of agents to the facility within the context of mechanism design without money. In such a variation, agents have preferences on the ideal locations of the facility on a real line, and the facility's location is fixed in advance where (re)locating the facility is not possible due to various constraints (e.g., limited space and construction costs). To improve the accessibility of agents to facilities, existing mechanism design literature in FLPs has proposed to structurally modify the real line (e.g., by adding a new interval) or provide shuttle services between two points when structural modifications are not possible. In this paper, we focus on the latter approach and propose to construct an accessibility range to extend the accessibility of the facility. In the range, agents can receive accommodations (e.g., school buses, campus shuttles, or pickup services) to help reach the facility. Therefore, the cost of each agent is the distance from their ideal location to the facility (possibility) through the range. We focus on designing strategyproof mechanisms that elicit true ideal locations from the agents and construct accessibility ranges (intervals) to approximately minimize the social cost or the maximum cost of agents. For both social and maximum costs, we design group strategyproof mechanisms with asymptotically tight bounds on the approximation ratios."
Comparative Analysis of Pretrained Audio Representations in Music Recommender Systems,"Over the years, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has proposed various models pretrained on large amounts of music data. Transfer learning showcases the proven effectiveness of pretrained backend models with a broad spectrum of downstream tasks, including auto-tagging and genre classification. However, MIR papers generally do not explore the efficiency of pretrained models for Music Recommender Systems (MRS). In addition, the Recommender Systems community tends to favour traditional end-to-end neural network learning over these models. Our research addresses this gap and evaluates the applicability of six pretrained backend models (MusicFM, Music2Vec, MERT, EncodecMAE, Jukebox, and MusiCNN) in the context of MRS. We assess their performance using three recommendation models: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), shallow neural network, and BERT4Rec. Our findings suggest that pretrained audio representations exhibit significant performance variability between traditional MIR tasks and MRS, indicating that valuable aspects of musical information captured by backend models may differ depending on the task. This study establishes a foundation for further exploration of pretrained audio representations to enhance music recommendation systems."
Clean Label Attacks against SLU Systems,"Poisoning backdoor attacks involve an adversary manipulating the training data to induce certain behaviors in the victim model by inserting a trigger in the signal at inference time. We adapted clean label backdoor (CLBD)-data poisoning attacks, which do not modify the training labels, on state-of-the-art speech recognition models that support/perform a Spoken Language Understanding task, achieving 99.8% attack success rate by poisoning 10% of the training data. We analyzed how varying the signal-strength of the poison, percent of samples poisoned, and choice of trigger impact the attack. We also found that CLBD attacks are most successful when applied to training samples that are inherently hard for a proxy model. Using this strategy, we achieved an attack success rate of 99.3% by poisoning a meager 1.5% of the training data. Finally, we applied two previously developed defenses against gradient-based attacks, and found that they attain mixed success against poisoning."
Why some audio signal short-time Fourier transform coefficients have nonuniform phase distributions,"The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) represents a window of audio samples as a set of complex coefficients. These are advantageously viewed as magnitudes and phases and the overall distribution of phases is very often assumed to be uniform. We show that when audio signal STFT phase distributions are analyzed per-frequency or per-magnitude range, they can be far from uniform. That is, the uniform phase distribution assumption obscures significant important details. We explain the significance of the nonuniform phase distributions and how they might be exploited, derive their source, and explain why the choice of the STFT window shape influences the nonuniformity of the resulting phase distributions."
"Predicting Trust In Autonomous Vehicles: Modeling Young Adult Psychosocial Traits, Risk-Benefit Attitudes, And Driving Factors With Machine Learning","Low trust remains a significant barrier to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption. To design trustworthy AVs, we need to better understand the individual traits, attitudes, and experiences that impact people's trust judgements. We use machine learning to understand the most important factors that contribute to young adult trust based on a comprehensive set of personal factors gathered via survey (n = 1457). Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person's mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research."
Revisiting Local PageRank Estimation on Undirected Graphs: Simple and Optimal,"We propose a simple and optimal algorithm, BackMC, for local PageRank estimation in undirected graphs: given an arbitrary target node $t$ in an undirected graph $G$ comprising $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, BackMC accurately estimates the PageRank score of node $t$ while assuring a small relative error and a high success probability. The worst-case computational complexity of BackMC is upper bounded by $O\left(\frac{1}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$, where $d_{\mathrm{min}}$ denotes the minimum degree of $G$, and $d_t$ denotes the degree of $t$, respectively. Compared to the previously best upper bound of $ O\left(\log{n}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$ (VLDB '23), which is derived from a significantly more complex algorithm and analysis, our BackMC improves the computational complexity for this problem by a factor of $\Theta\left(\frac{\log{n}}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\right)$ with a much simpler algorithm. Furthermore, we establish a matching lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$ for any algorithm that attempts to solve the problem of local PageRank estimation, demonstrating the theoretical optimality of our BackMC. We conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale real-world and synthetic graphs, where BackMC consistently shows superior performance."
Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling,"Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.   A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.   We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy."
Thermal Modelling of Battery Cells for Optimal Tab and Surface Cooling Control,"Optimal cooling that minimises thermal gradients and the average temperature is essential for enhanced battery safety and health. This work presents a new modelling approach for battery cells of different shapes by integrating Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin method and model component decomposition. As a result, a library of reduced-order computationally efficient battery thermal models is obtained, characterised by different numbers of states. These models are validated against a high-fidelity finite element model and are compared with a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) model under real-world vehicle driving and battery cooling scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed model with four states can faithfully capture the two-dimensional thermal dynamics, while the model with only one state significantly outperforms the widely-used two-state TEC model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing computation time by 28.7\%. Furthermore, our developed models allow for independent control of tab and surface cooling channels, enabling effective thermal performance optimisation. Additionally, the proposed model's versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated through various applications, including the evaluation of different cooling scenarios, closed-loop temperature control, and cell design optimisation."
Fast DCT+: A Family of Fast Transforms Based on Rank-One Updates of the Path Graph,"This paper develops fast graph Fourier transform (GFT) algorithms with O(n log n) runtime complexity for rank-one updates of the path graph. We first show that several commonly-used audio and video coding transforms belong to this class of GFTs, which we denote by DCT+. Next, starting from an arbitrary generalized graph Laplacian and using rank-one perturbation theory, we provide a factorization for the GFT after perturbation. This factorization is our central result and reveals a progressive structure: we first apply the unperturbed Laplacian's GFT and then multiply the result by a Cauchy matrix. By specializing this decomposition to path graphs and exploiting the properties of Cauchy matrices, we show that Fast DCT+ algorithms exist. We also demonstrate that progressivity can speed up computations in applications involving multiple transforms related by rank-one perturbations (e.g., video coding) when combined with pruning strategies. Our results can be extended to other graphs and rank-k perturbations. Runtime analyses show that Fast DCT+ provides computational gains over the naive method for graph sizes larger than 64, with runtime approximately equal to that of 8 DCTs."
Modeling Rational Adaptation of Visual Search to Hierarchical Structures,"Efficient attention deployment in visual search is limited by human visual memory, yet this limitation can be offset by exploiting the environment's structure. This paper introduces a computational cognitive model that simulates how the human visual system uses visual hierarchies to prevent refixations in sequential attention deployment. The model adopts computational rationality, positing behaviors as adaptations to cognitive constraints and environmental structures. In contrast to earlier models that predict search performance for hierarchical information, our model does not include predefined assumptions about particular search strategies. Instead, our model's search strategy emerges as a result of adapting to the environment through reinforcement learning algorithms. In an experiment with human participants we test the model's prediction that structured environments reduce visual search times compared to random tasks. Our model's predictions correspond well with human search performance across various set sizes for both structured and unstructured visual layouts. Our work improves understanding of the adaptive nature of visual search in hierarchically structured environments and informs the design of optimized search spaces."
User Identity Linkage on Social Networks: A Review of Modern Techniques and Applications,"In an Online Social Network (OSN), users can create a unique public persona by crafting a user identity that may encompass profile details, content, and network-related information. As a result, a relevant task of interest is related to the ability to link identities across different OSNs. Linking users across social networks can have multiple implications in several contexts both at the individual level and at the group level. At the individual level, the main interest in linking the same identity across social networks is to enable a better knowledge of each user. At the group level, linking user identities through different OSNs helps in predicting user behaviors, network dynamics, information diffusion, and migration phenomena across social media. The process of tying together user accounts on different OSNs is challenging and has attracted more and more research attention in the last fifteen years. The purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of recent studies (from 2016 to the present) on User Identity Linkage (UIL) methods across online social networks. This review aims to offer guidance for other researchers in the field by outlining the main problem formulations, the different feature extraction strategies, algorithms, machine learning models, datasets, and evaluation metrics proposed by researchers working in this area. The proposed overview takes a pragmatic perspective to highlight the concrete possibilities for accomplishing this task depending on the type of available data."
IMMERTWIN: A Mixed Reality Framework for Enhanced Robotic Arm Teleoperation,"We present IMMERTWIN, a mixed reality framework for enhance robotic arm teleoperation using a closed-loop digital twin as a bridge for interaction between the user and the robotic system. We evaluated IMMERTWIN by performing a medium-scale user survey with 26 participants on two robots. Users were asked to teleoperate with both robots inside the virtual environment to pick and place 3 cubes in a tower and to repeat this task as many times as possible in 10 minutes, with only 5 minutes of training beforehand. Our experimental results show that most users were able to succeed by building at least a tower of 3 cubes regardless of the robot used and a maximum of 10 towers (1 tower per minute). In addition, users preferred to use IMMERTWIN over our previous work, TELESIM, as it caused them less mental workload. The project website and source code can be found at: https://cvas-ug.github.io/immertwin"
Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating Community Rule Compliance,"Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems."
Improving governance outcomes through AI documentation: Bridging theory and practice,"Documentation plays a crucial role in both external accountability and internal governance of AI systems. Although there are many proposals for documenting AI data, models, systems, and methods, the ways these practices enhance governance as well as the challenges practitioners and organizations face with documentation remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze 37 proposed documentation frameworks and 21 empirical studies evaluating their use. We identify potential hypotheses about how documentation can strengthen governance, such as informing stakeholders about AI risks and usage, fostering collaboration, encouraging ethical reflection, and reinforcing best practices. However, empirical evidence shows that practitioners often encounter obstacles that prevent documentation from achieving these goals. We also highlight key considerations for organizations when designing documentation, such as determining the appropriate level of detail and balancing automation in the process. Finally, we offer recommendations for further research and for implementing effective documentation practices in real-world contexts."
PINNfluence: Influence Functions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies."
A Bayesian Approach to Clustering via the Proper Bayesian Bootstrap: the Bayesian Bagged Clustering (BBC) algorithm,"The paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised techniques in the field of clustering. A new method is proposed to enhance existing literature models using the proper Bayesian bootstrap to improve results in terms of robustness and interpretability. Our approach is organized in two steps: k-means clustering is used for prior elicitation, then proper Bayesian bootstrap is applied as resampling method in an ensemble clustering approach. Results are analyzed introducing measures of uncertainty based on Shannon entropy. The proposal provides clear indication on the optimal number of clusters, as well as a better representation of the clustered data. Empirical results are provided on simulated data showing the methodological and empirical advances obtained."
Pushing the boundaries of event subsampling in event-based video classification using CNNs,"Event cameras offer low-power visual sensing capabilities ideal for edge-device applications. However, their high event rate, driven by high temporal details, can be restrictive in terms of bandwidth and computational resources. In edge AI applications, determining the minimum amount of events for specific tasks can allow reducing the event rate to improve bandwidth, memory, and processing efficiency. In this paper, we study the effect of event subsampling on the accuracy of event data classification using convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Surprisingly, across various datasets, the number of events per video can be reduced by an order of magnitude with little drop in accuracy, revealing the extent to which we can push the boundaries in accuracy vs. event rate trade-off. Additionally, we also find that lower classification accuracy in high subsampling rates is not solely attributable to information loss due to the subsampling of the events, but that the training of CNNs can be challenging in highly subsampled scenarios, where the sensitivity to hyperparameters increases. We quantify training instability across multiple event-based classification datasets using a novel metric for evaluating the hyperparameter sensitivity of CNNs in different subsampling settings. Finally, we analyze the weight gradients of the network to gain insight into this instability."
National Treasure: The Call for e-Democracy and US Election Security,"Faith in the US electoral system is at risk. This issue stems from trust or lack thereof. Poor leaders ranted and attempted to sew discord in the democratic process and even tried to influence election results. Historically, the US has relied on paper ballots to cast private votes. Votes are watered down by the Electoral College. Elections are contested due to voter IDs and proof of citizenship. Methods of voting are nonsensically complex. In the technology age, this can be solved with a Smartcard National ID backed by Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI). This could be a method to restore hope in democracy and move the country back towards elections under a Popular Vote. Numbers are empirical and immutable and can solve the issue of Election Security in a bipartisan way. NATO allies like Estonia have already broken ground in using technology for eDemocracy or (Internet-based) iVoting. Acknowledging cyber attacks will happen, this is an opportunity for DHS and DOD (CYBERCOM) to collaborate on domestic operations and protect critical election infrastructure. This idea will not fix malicious information operations or civil stupidity. However, this is the way forward to securing elections now and forever.

On the Viability of Open-Source Financial Rails: Economic Security of Permissionless Consensus,"Bitcoin demonstrated the possibility of a financial ledger that operates without the need for a trusted central authority. However, concerns persist regarding its security and considerable energy consumption. We assess the consensus protocols that underpin Bitcoin's functionality, questioning whether they can ensure economically meaningful security while maintaining a permissionless design that allows free entry of operators. We answer this affirmatively by constructing a protocol that guarantees economic security and preserves Bitcoin's permissionless design. This protocol's security does not depend on monetary payments to miners or immense electricity consumption, which our analysis suggests are ineffective. Our framework integrates economic theory with distributed systems theory, and highlights the role of the protocol's user community."
"Generic and ML Workloads in an HPC Datacenter: Node Energy, Job Failures, and Node-Job Analysis","HPC datacenters offer a backbone to the modern digital society. Increasingly, they run Machine Learning (ML) jobs next to generic, compute-intensive workloads, supporting science, business, and other decision-making processes. However, understanding how ML jobs impact the operation of HPC datacenters, relative to generic jobs, remains desirable but understudied. In this work, we leverage long-term operational data, collected from a national-scale production HPC datacenter, and statistically compare how ML and generic jobs can impact the performance, failures, resource utilization, and energy consumption of HPC datacenters. Our study provides key insights, e.g., ML-related power usage causes GPU nodes to run into temperature limitations, median/mean runtime and failure rates are higher for ML jobs than for generic jobs, both ML and generic jobs exhibit highly variable arrival processes and resource demands, significant amounts of energy are spent on unsuccessfully terminating jobs, and concurrent jobs tend to terminate in the same state. We open-source our cleaned-up data traces on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13685426), and provide our analysis toolkit as software hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/atlarge-research/2024-icpads-hpc-workload-characterization). This study offers multiple benefits for data center administrators, who can improve operational efficiency, and for researchers, who can further improve system designs, scheduling techniques, etc."
A Diffusion Approach to Radiance Field Relighting using Multi-Illumination Synthesis,"Relighting radiance fields is severely underconstrained for multi-view data, which is most often captured under a single illumination condition; It is especially hard for full scenes containing multiple objects. We introduce a method to create relightable radiance fields using such single-illumination data by exploiting priors extracted from 2D image diffusion models. We first fine-tune a 2D diffusion model on a multi-illumination dataset conditioned by light direction, allowing us to augment a single-illumination capture into a realistic -- but possibly inconsistent -- multi-illumination dataset from directly defined light directions. We use this augmented data to create a relightable radiance field represented by 3D Gaussian splats. To allow direct control of light direction for low-frequency lighting, we represent appearance with a multi-layer perceptron parameterized on light direction. To enforce multi-view consistency and overcome inaccuracies we optimize a per-image auxiliary feature vector. We show results on synthetic and real multi-view data under single illumination, demonstrating that our method successfully exploits 2D diffusion model priors to allow realistic 3D relighting for complete scenes.

DELTA: Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty for Active Graph Domain Adaptation,"Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from substructures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches."
Unveiling User Engagement Patterns on Stack Exchange Through Network Analysis,"Stack Exchange, a question-and-answer(Q&A) platform, has exhibited signs of a declining user engagement. This paper investigates user engagement dynamics across various Stack Exchange communities including Data science, AI, software engineering, project management, and GenAI. We propose a network graph representing users as nodes and their interactions as edges. We explore engagement patterns through key network metrics including Degree Centerality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. The study findings reveal distinct community dynamics across these platforms, with smaller communities demonstrating more concentrated user influence, while larger platforms showcase more distributed engagement. Besides, the results showed insights into user roles, influence, and potential strategies for enhancing engagement. This research contributes to understanding of online community behavior and provides a framework for future studies to improve the Stack Exchange user experience."
Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge,"In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising, aiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices, like low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain the ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus jointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have little computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing a novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to search for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures outperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and classification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our approach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like medical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections."
Neural network Approximations for Reaction-Diffusion Equations -- Homogeneous Neumann Boundary Conditions and Long-time Integrations,"Reaction-Diffusion systems arise in diverse areas of science and engineering. Due to the peculiar characteristics of such equations, analytic solutions are usually not available and numerical methods are the main tools for approximating the solutions. In the last decade, artificial neural networks have become an active area of development for solving partial differential equations. However, several challenges remain unresolved with these methods when applied to reaction-diffusion equations. In this work, we focus on two main problems. The implementation of homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and long-time integrations. For the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, we explore four different neural network methods based on the PINN approach. For the long time integration in Reaction-Diffusion systems, we propose a domain splitting method in time and provide detailed comparisons between different implementations of no-flux boundary conditions. We show that the domain splitting method is crucial in the neural network approach, for long time integration in Reaction-Diffusion systems. We demonstrate numerically that domain splitting is essential for avoiding local minima, and the use of different boundary conditions further enhances the splitting technique by improving numerical approximations. To validate the proposed methods, we provide numerical examples for the Diffusion, the Bistable and the Barkley equations and provide a detailed discussion and comparisons of the proposed methods."
Average-Reward Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Underactuated Double Pendulum Tasks,"This report presents a solution for the swing-up and stabilisation tasks of the acrobot and the pendubot, developed for the AI Olympics competition at IROS 2024. Our approach employs the Average-Reward Entropy Advantage Policy Optimization (AR-EAPO), a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that combines average-reward RL and maximum entropy RL. Results demonstrate that our controller achieves improved performance and robustness scores compared to established baseline methods in both the acrobot and pendubot scenarios, without the need for a heavily engineered reward function or system model. The current results are applicable exclusively to the simulation stage setup."
"Emerging Reliance Behaviors in Human-AI Text Generation: Hallucinations, Data Quality Assessment, and Cognitive Forcing Functions","In this paper, we investigate the impact of hallucinations and cognitive forcing functions in human-AI collaborative text generation tasks, focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating high-quality conversational data. LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts."
SynSUM -- Synthetic Benchmark with Structured and Unstructured Medical Records,"We present the SynSUM benchmark, a synthetic dataset linking unstructured clinical notes to structured background variables. The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. The dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/prabaey/SynSUM."
Optimization and Generalization Guarantees for Weight Normalization,"Weight normalization (WeightNorm) is widely used in practice for the training of deep neural networks and modern deep learning libraries have built-in implementations of it. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks."
Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks: Steering User Interest via Neighbor Influence,"Recommending items solely catering to users' historical interests narrows users' horizons. Recent works have considered steering target users beyond their historical interests by directly adjusting items exposed to them. However, the recommended items for direct steering might not align perfectly with users' interests evolution, detrimentally affecting target users' experience. To avoid this issue, we propose a new task named Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks (PRSN) that indirectly steers users' interest by utilizing the influence of social neighbors, i.e., indirect steering by adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors. The key to PRSN lies in answering an interventional question: what would a target user's feedback be on a target item if the item is exposed to the user's different neighbors? To answer this question, we resort to causal inference and formalize PRSN as: (1) estimating the potential feedback of a user on an item, under the network interference by the item's exposure to the user's neighbors; and (2) adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors to trade off steering performance and the damage to the neighbors' experience. To this end, we propose a Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework with two key modules: (1)an interference representation-based estimation module for modeling potential feedback; and (2) a post-learning-based optimization module for optimizing a target item's exposure to trade off steering performance and the neighbors' experience by greedy search. We conduct extensive semi-simulation experiments based on three real-world datasets, validating the steering effectiveness of NIRec."
LLM-based Weak Supervision Framework for Query Intent Classification in Video Search,"Streaming services have reshaped how we discover and engage with digital entertainment. Despite these advancements, effectively understanding the wide spectrum of user search queries continues to pose a significant challenge. An accurate query understanding system that can handle a variety of entities that represent different user intents is essential for delivering an enhanced user experience. We can build such a system by training a natural language understanding (NLU) model; however, obtaining high-quality labeled training data in this specialized domain is a substantial obstacle. Manual annotation is costly and impractical for capturing users' vast vocabulary variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) through weak supervision to automatically annotate a vast collection of user search queries. Using prompt engineering and a diverse set of LLM personas, we generate training data that matches human annotator expectations. By incorporating domain knowledge via Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, our approach leverages the labeled data to train low-latency models optimized for real-time inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrated that our approach outperformed the baseline with an average relative gain of 113% in recall. Furthermore, our novel prompt engineering framework yields higher quality LLM-generated data to be used for weak supervision; we observed 47.60% improvement over baseline in agreement rate between LLM predictions and human annotations with respect to F1 score, weighted according to the distribution of occurrences of the search queries. Our persona selection routing mechanism further adds an additional 3.67% increase in weighted F1 score on top of our novel prompt engineering framework."
"Yes, Prime Minister, question order does matter -- and it's certainly not classical! But is it quantum?","Response to a poll can be manipulated by means of a series of leading questions. We show that such phenomena cannot be explained by use of classical probability theory, whereas quantum probability theory admits a possibility of offering an explanation. Admissible transformation rules in quantum probability, however, do impose some constraints on the modelling of cognitive behaviour, which are highlighted here. Focusing on a recent poll conducted by Ipsos on a set of questions posed by Sir Humphrey Appleby in an episode of the British political satire \textit{Yes, Prime Minister}, we show that the resulting data cannot be explained quite so simply using quantum rules, although it seems not impossible."
ClearDepth: Enhanced Stereo Perception of Transparent Objects for Robotic Manipulation,"Transparent object depth perception poses a challenge in everyday life and logistics, primarily due to the inability of standard 3D sensors to accurately capture depth on transparent or reflective surfaces. This limitation significantly affects depth map and point cloud-reliant applications, especially in robotic manipulation. We developed a vision transformer-based algorithm for stereo depth recovery of transparent objects. This approach is complemented by an innovative feature post-fusion module, which enhances the accuracy of depth recovery by structural features in images. To address the high costs associated with dataset collection for stereo camera-based perception of transparent objects, our method incorporates a parameter-aligned, domain-adaptive, and physically realistic Sim2Real simulation for efficient data generation, accelerated by AI algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's exceptional Sim2Real generalizability in real-world scenarios, enabling precise depth mapping of transparent objects to assist in robotic manipulation. Project details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/cleardepth/ ."
Multi forests: Variable importance for multi-class outcomes,"In prediction tasks with multi-class outcomes, identifying covariates specifically associated with one or more outcome classes can be important. Conventional variable importance measures (VIMs) from random forests (RFs), like permutation and Gini importance, focus on overall predictive performance or node purity, without differentiating between the classes. Therefore, they can be expected to fail to distinguish class-associated covariates from covariates that only distinguish between groups of classes. We introduce a VIM called multi-class VIM, tailored for identifying exclusively class-associated covariates, via a novel RF variant called multi forests (MuFs). The trees in MuFs use both multi-way and binary splitting. The multi-way splits generate child nodes for each class, using a split criterion that evaluates how well these nodes represent their respective classes. This setup forms the basis of the multi-class VIM, which measures the discriminatory ability of the splits performed in the respective covariates with regard to this split criterion. Alongside the multi-class VIM, we introduce a second VIM, the discriminatory VIM. This measure, based on the binary splits, assesses the strength of the general influence of the covariates, irrespective of their class-associatedness. Simulation studies demonstrate that the multi-class VIM specifically ranks class-associated covariates highly, unlike conventional VIMs which also rank other types of covariates highly. Analyses of 121 datasets reveal that MuFs often have slightly lower predictive performance compared to conventional RFs. This is, however, not a limiting factor given the algorithm's primary purpose of calculating the multi-class VIM."
XSub: Explanation-Driven Adversarial Attack against Blackbox Classifiers via Feature Substitution,"Despite its significant benefits in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, explainable AI (XAI) has yet to reach its full potential in real-world applications. One key challenge is that XAI can unintentionally provide adversaries with insights into black-box models, inevitably increasing their vulnerability to various attacks. In this paper, we develop a novel explanation-driven adversarial attack against black-box classifiers based on feature substitution, called XSub. The key idea of XSub is to strategically replace important features (identified via XAI) in the original sample with corresponding important features from a ""golden sample"" of a different label, thereby increasing the likelihood of the model misclassifying the perturbed sample. The degree of feature substitution is adjustable, allowing us to control how much of the original samples information is replaced. This flexibility effectively balances a trade-off between the attacks effectiveness and its stealthiness. XSub is also highly cost-effective in that the number of required queries to the prediction model and the explanation model in conducting the attack is in O(1). In addition, XSub can be easily extended to launch backdoor attacks in case the attacker has access to the models training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that XSub is not only effective and stealthy but also cost-effective, enabling its application across a wide range of AI models."
Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation,"Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism. The website of the code is \textit{https://github.com/gorgen2020/LSSDM\_imputation}."
Farmer.Chat: Scaling AI-Powered Agricultural Services for Smallholder Farmers,"Small and medium-sized agricultural holders face challenges like limited access to localized, timely information, impacting productivity and sustainability. Traditional extension services, which rely on in-person agents, struggle with scalability and timely delivery, especially in remote areas. We introduce Farmer.Chat, a generative AI-powered chatbot designed to address these issues. Leveraging Generative AI, Farmer.Chat offers personalized, reliable, and contextually relevant advice, overcoming limitations of previous chatbots in deterministic dialogue flows, language support, and unstructured data processing. Deployed in four countries, Farmer.Chat has engaged over 15,000 farmers and answered over 300,000 queries. This paper highlights how Farmer.Chat's innovative use of GenAI enhances agricultural service scalability and effectiveness. Our evaluation, combining quantitative analysis and qualitative insights, highlights Farmer.Chat's effectiveness in improving farming practices, enhancing trust, response quality, and user engagement."
HLTCOE JHU Submission to the Voice Privacy Challenge 2024,"We present a number of systems for the Voice Privacy Challenge, including voice conversion based systems such as the kNN-VC method and the WavLM voice Conversion method, and text-to-speech (TTS) based systems including Whisper-VITS. We found that while voice conversion systems better preserve emotional content, they struggle to conceal speaker identity in semi-white-box attack scenarios; conversely, TTS methods perform better at anonymization and worse at emotion preservation. Finally, we propose a random admixture system which seeks to balance out the strengths and weaknesses of the two category of systems, achieving a strong EER of over 40% while maintaining UAR at a respectable 47%."
Estimatable variation neural networks and their application to ODEs and scalar hyperbolic conservation laws,"We introduce estimatable variation neural networks (EVNNs), a class of neural networks that allow a computationally cheap estimate on the $BV$ norm motivated by the space $BMV$ of functions with bounded M-variation. We prove a universal approximation theorem for EVNNs and discuss possible implementations. We construct sequences of loss functionals for ODEs and scalar hyperbolic conservation laws for which a vanishing loss leads to convergence. Moreover, we show the existence of sequences of loss minimizing neural networks if the solution is an element of $BMV$. Several numerical test cases illustrate that it is possible to use standard techniques to minimize these loss functionals for EVNNs."
Affective Computing Has Changed: The Foundation Model Disruption,"The dawn of Foundation Models has on the one hand revolutionised a wide range of research problems, and, on the other hand, democratised the access and use of AI-based tools by the general public. We even observe an incursion of these models into disciplines related to human psychology, such as the Affective Computing domain, suggesting their affective, emerging capabilities. In this work, we aim to raise awareness of the power of Foundation Models in the field of Affective Computing by synthetically generating and analysing multimodal affective data, focusing on vision, linguistics, and speech (acoustics). We also discuss some fundamental problems, such as ethical issues and regulatory aspects, related to the use of Foundation Models in this research area."
Gaussian is All You Need: A Unified Framework for Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion Posterior Sampling,"Diffusion models can generate a variety of high-quality images by modeling complex data distributions. Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps within the diffusion reverse sampling process. The data consistency steps rely on an approximate likelihood function. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. We present comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches."
D2-MLP: Dynamic Decomposed MLP Mixer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks are widely used in various segmentation tasks in medical images. However, they are challenged to learn global features adaptively due to the inherent locality of convolutional operations. In contrast, MLP Mixers are proposed as a backbone to learn global information across channels with low complexity. However, they cannot capture spatial features efficiently. Additionally, they lack effective mechanisms to fuse and mix features adaptively. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Decomposed Mixer module. It is designed to employ novel Mixers to extract features and aggregate information across different spatial locations and channels. Additionally, it employs novel dynamic mixing mechanisms to model inter-dependencies between channel and spatial feature representations and to fuse them adaptively. Subsequently, we incorporate it into a U-shaped Transformer-based architecture to generate a novel network, termed the Dynamic Decomposed MLP Mixer. We evaluated it for medical image segmentation on two datasets, and it achieved superior segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art methods."
AnyBipe: An End-to-End Framework for Training and Deploying Bipedal Robots Guided by Large Language Models,"Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention."
Kraus is King: High-order Completely Positive and Trace Preserving (CPTP) Low Rank Method for the Lindblad Master Equation,We design high order accurate methods that exploit low rank structure in the density matrix while respecting the essential structure of the Lindblad equation. Our methods preserves complete positivity and are trace preserving.
Ensuring Adherence to Standards in Experiment-Related Metadata Entered Via Spreadsheets,"Scientists increasingly recognize the importance of providing rich, standards-adherent metadata to describe their experimental results. Despite the availability of sophisticated tools to assist in the process of data annotation, investigators generally seem to prefer to use spreadsheets when supplying metadata, despite the limitations of spreadsheets in ensuring metadata consistency and compliance with formal specifications. In this paper, we describe an end-to-end approach that supports spreadsheet-based entry of metadata, while ensuring rigorous adherence to community-based metadata standards and providing quality control. Our methods employ several key components, including customizable templates that capture metadata standards and that can inform the spreadsheets that investigators use to author metadata, controlled terminologies and ontologies for defining metadata values that can be accessed directly from a spreadsheet, and an interactive Web-based tool that allows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in their spreadsheet-based metadata. We demonstrate how this approach is being deployed in a biomedical consortium known as HuBMAP to define and collect metadata about a wide range of biological assays."
Synthetic Human Memories: AI-Edited Images and Videos Can Implant False Memories and Distort Recollection,"AI is increasingly used to enhance images and videos, both intentionally and unintentionally. As AI editing tools become more integrated into smartphones, users can modify or animate photos into realistic videos. This study examines the impact of AI-altered visuals on false memories--recollections of events that didn't occur or deviate from reality. In a pre-registered study, 200 participants were divided into four conditions of 50 each. Participants viewed original images, completed a filler task, then saw stimuli corresponding to their assigned condition: unedited images, AI-edited images, AI-generated videos, or AI-generated videos of AI-edited images. AI-edited visuals significantly increased false recollections, with AI-generated videos of AI-edited images having the strongest effect (2.05x compared to control). Confidence in false memories was also highest for this condition (1.19x compared to control). We discuss potential applications in HCI, such as therapeutic memory reframing, and challenges in ethical, legal, political, and societal domains."
Exploring Action-Centric Representations Through the Lens of Rate-Distortion Theory,"Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception."
Extending the Benefits of Parallel Elasticity across Multiple Actuation Tasks: A Geometric and Optimization-Based Approach,"A spring in parallel with an effort source (e.g., electric motor or human muscle) can reduce its energy consumption and effort (i.e., torque or force) depending on the spring stiffness, spring preload, and actuation task. However, selecting the spring stiffness and preload that guarantees effort or energy reduction for an arbitrary set of tasks is a design challenge. This work formulates a convex optimization problem to guarantee that a parallel spring reduces the root-mean-square source effort or energy consumption for multiple tasks. Specifically, we guarantee the benefits across multiple tasks by enforcing a set of convex quadratic constraints in our optimization variables -- the parallel spring stiffness and preload. These quadratic constraints are equivalent to ellipses in the stiffness and preload plane, any combination of stiffness and preload inside the ellipse represents a parallel spring that minimizes effort source or energy consumption with respect to an actuator without a spring. This geometric interpretation intuitively guides the stiffness and preload selection process. We analytically and experimentally prove the convex quadratic function of the spring stiffness and preload. As applications, we analyze the stiffness and preload selection of a parallel spring for a knee exoskeleton using human muscle as the effort source and a prosthetic ankle powered by electric motors. To promote adoption, the optimization and geometric methods are available as supplemental open-source software that can be executed in a web browser."
Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust Benchmark,"Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities."
Interactive Masked Image Modeling for Multimodal Object Detection in Remote Sensing,"Object detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various Earth observation applications. However, unlike object detection in natural scene images, this task is particularly challenging due to the abundance of small, often barely visible objects across diverse terrains. To address these challenges, multimodal learning can be used to integrate features from different data modalities, thereby improving detection accuracy. Nonetheless, the performance of multimodal learning is often constrained by the limited size of labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose to use Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a pre-training technique, leveraging self-supervised learning on unlabeled data to enhance detection performance. However, conventional MIM such as MAE which uses masked tokens without any contextual information, struggles to capture the fine-grained details due to a lack of interactions with other parts of image. To address this, we propose a new interactive MIM method that can establish interactions between different tokens, which is particularly beneficial for object detection in remote sensing. The extensive ablation studies and evluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Detect Fake with Fake: Leveraging Synthetic Data-driven Representation for Synthetic Image Detection,"Are general-purpose visual representations acquired solely from synthetic data useful for detecting fake images? In this work, we show the effectiveness of synthetic data-driven representations for synthetic image detection. Upon analysis, we find that vision transformers trained by the latest visual representation learners with synthetic data can effectively distinguish fake from real images without seeing any real images during pre-training. Notably, using SynCLR as the backbone in a state-of-the-art detection method demonstrates a performance improvement of +10.32 mAP and +4.73% accuracy over the widely used CLIP, when tested on previously unseen GAN models. Code is available at https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/detect-fake-with-fake."
Vertex identification to a forest,"Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a graph class and $k\in\mathbb{N}$. We say a graph $G$ admits a \emph{$k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$} if there is a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of some set $X\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that after identifying each part in $\mathcal{P}$ to a single vertex, the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. The graph parameter ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is defined so that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ admits a $k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$, and the problem of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$} asks, given a graph $G$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, whether ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k$. If we set $\mathcal{H}$ to be the class $\mathcal{F}$ of acyclic graphs, we generate the problem \textsc{Identification to Forest}, which we show to be {\sf NP}-complete. We prove that, when parameterized by the size $k$ of the identification set, it admits a kernel of size $2k+1$. For our kernel we reveal a close relation of \textsc{Identification to Forest} with the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. We also study the combinatorics of the \textsf{yes}-instances of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$}, i.e., the class $\mathcal{H}^{(k)}:=\{G\mid {\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k\}$, {which we show to be minor-closed for every $k$} when $\mathcal{H}$ is minor-closed. We prove that the minor-obstructions of $\mathcal{F}^{(k)}$ are of size at most $2k+4$. We also prove that every graph $G$ such that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{F}}(G)$ is sufficiently big contains as a minor either a cycle on $k$ vertices, or $k$ disjoint triangles, or the \emph{$k$-marguerite} graph, that is the graph obtained by $k$ disjoint triangles by identifying one vertex of each of them into the same vertex."
Exploring the Impact of Data Quantity on ASR in Extremely Low-resource Languages,"This study investigates the efficacy of data augmentation techniques for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on two endangered Austronesian languages, Amis and Seediq. Recognizing the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL) in low-resource settings, we explore the impact of data volume on the continued pre-training of SSL models. We propose a novel data-selection scheme leveraging a multilingual corpus to augment the limited target language data. This scheme utilizes a language classifier to extract utterance embeddings and employs one-class classifiers to identify utterances phonetically and phonologically proximate to the target languages. Utterances are ranked and selected based on their decision scores, ensuring the inclusion of highly relevant data in the SSL-ASR pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, yielding substantial improvements in ASR performance for both Amis and Seediq. These findings underscore the feasibility and promise of data augmentation through cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource language ASR."
Computing shortest paths amid non-overlapping weighted disks,"In this article, we present an approximation algorithm for solving the Weighted Region Problem amidst a set of $ n $ non-overlapping weighted disks in the plane. For a given parameter $ \varepsilon \in (0,1]$, the length of the approximate path is at most $ (1 +\varepsilon) $ times larger than the length of the actual shortest path. The algorithm is based on the discretization of the space by placing points on the boundary of the disks. Using such a discretization we can use Dijkstra's algorithm for computing a shortest path in the geometric graph obtained in (pseudo-)polynomial time."
Exploring Graph Structure Comprehension Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Case Studies,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing various data structures, including graphs. While previous research has focused on developing textual encoding methods for graph representation, the emergence of multimodal LLMs presents a new frontier for graph comprehension. These advanced models, capable of processing both text and images, offer potential improvements in graph understanding by incorporating visual representations alongside traditional textual data. This study investigates the impact of graph visualisations on LLM performance across a range of benchmark tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities."
The Fundamental Subspaces of Ensemble Kalman Inversion,"Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) methods are a family of iterative methods for solving weighted least-squares problems, especially those arising in scientific and engineering inverse problems in which unknown parameters or states are estimated from observed data by minimizing the weighted square norm of the data misfit. Implementation of EKI requires only evaluation of the forward model mapping the unknown to the data, and does not require derivatives or adjoints of the forward model. The methods therefore offer an attractive alternative to gradient-based optimization approaches in large-scale inverse problems where evaluating derivatives or adjoints of the forward model is computationally intractable. This work presents a new analysis of the behavior of both deterministic and stochastic versions of basic EKI for linear observation operators, resulting in a natural interpretation of EKI's convergence properties in terms of ``fundamental subspaces'' analogous to Strang's fundamental subspaces of linear algebra. Our analysis directly examines the discrete EKI iterations instead of their continuous-time limits considered in previous analyses, and provides spectral decompositions that define six fundamental subspaces of EKI spanning both observation and state spaces. This approach verifies convergence rates previously derived for continuous-time limits, and yields new results describing both deterministic and stochastic EKI convergence behavior with respect to the standard minimum-norm weighted least squares solution in terms of the fundamental subspaces. Numerical experiments illustrate our theoretical results."
Adjoint Matching: Fine-tuning Flow and Diffusion Generative Models with Memoryless Stochastic Optimal Control,"Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there has not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity."
Optimized Design of A Haptic Unit for Vibrotactile Amplitude Modulation,"Communicating information to users is a crucial aspect of human-machine interaction. Vibrotactile feedback encodes information into spatiotemporal vibrations, enabling users to perceive tactile sensations. It offers advantages such as lightweight, wearability, and high stability, with broad applications in sensory substitution, virtual reality, education, and healthcare. However, existing haptic unit designs lack amplitude modulation capabilities, which limits their applications. This paper proposed an optimized design of the haptic unit from the perspective of vibration amplitude modulation. A modified elastic model was developed to describe the propagation and attenuation mechanisms of vibration in the skin. Based on the model, two types of hierarchical architectural design were proposed. The design incorporated various materials arranged in multiple layers to amplify or attenuate the vibration amplitude as it traveled through the structure. An experimental platform was built to evaluate the performance of the optimized design."
Exploring System-Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Dynamic Model Selection,"Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm in which multiple mobile clients train a global model while keeping data local. These mobile clients can have various available memory and network bandwidth. However, to achieve the best global model performance, how we can utilize available memory and network bandwidth to the maximum remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to assign each client a subset of the global model, having different layers and channels on each layer. To realize that, we design a constrained model search process with early stop to improve efficiency of finding the models from such a very large space; and a data-free knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the global model performance when aggregating models of such different structures. For fair and reproducible comparison between different solutions, we develop a new system, which can directly allocate different memory and bandwidth to each client according to memory and bandwidth logs collected on mobile devices. The evaluation shows that our solution can have accuracy increase ranging from 2.43\% to 15.81\% and provide 5\% to 40\% more memory and bandwidth utilization with negligible extra running time, comparing to existing state-of-the-art system-heterogeneous federated learning methods under different available memory and bandwidth, non-i.i.d.~datasets, image and text tasks."
InstantDrag: Improving Interactivity in Drag-based Image Editing,"Drag-based image editing has recently gained popularity for its interactivity and precision. However, despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate samples within a second, drag editing still lags behind due to the challenge of accurately reflecting user interaction while maintaining image content. Some existing approaches rely on computationally intensive per-image optimization or intricate guidance-based methods, requiring additional inputs such as masks for movable regions and text prompts, thereby compromising the interactivity of the editing process. We introduce InstantDrag, an optimization-free pipeline that enhances interactivity and speed, requiring only an image and a drag instruction as input. InstantDrag consists of two carefully designed networks: a drag-conditioned optical flow generator (FlowGen) and an optical flow-conditioned diffusion model (FlowDiffusion). InstantDrag learns motion dynamics for drag-based image editing in real-world video datasets by decomposing the task into motion generation and motion-conditioned image generation. We demonstrate InstantDrag's capability to perform fast, photo-realistic edits without masks or text prompts through experiments on facial video datasets and general scenes. These results highlight the efficiency of our approach in handling drag-based image editing, making it a promising solution for interactive, real-time applications."
Using The Concept Hierarchy for Household Action Recognition,"We propose a method to systematically represent both the static and the dynamic components of environments, i.e. objects and agents, as well as the changes that are happening in the environment, i.e. the actions and skills performed by agents. Our approach, the Concept Hierarchy, provides the necessary information for autonomous systems to represent environment states, perform action modeling and recognition, and plan the execution of tasks. Additionally, the hierarchical structure supports generalization and knowledge transfer to environments. We rigorously define tasks, actions, skills, and affordances that enable human-understandable action and skill recognition."
DX2CT: Diffusion Model for 3D CT Reconstruction from Bi or Mono-planar 2D X-ray(s),"Computational tomography (CT) provides high-resolution medical imaging, but it can expose patients to high radiation. X-ray scanners have low radiation exposure, but their resolutions are low. This paper proposes a new conditional diffusion model, DX2CT, that reconstructs three-dimensional (3D) CT volumes from bi or mono-planar X-ray image(s). Proposed DX2CT consists of two key components: 1) modulating feature maps extracted from two-dimensional (2D) X-ray(s) with 3D positions of CT volume using a new transformer and 2) effectively using the modulated 3D position-aware feature maps as conditions of DX2CT. In particular, the proposed transformer can provide conditions with rich information of a target CT slice to the conditional diffusion model, enabling high-quality CT reconstruction. Our experiments with the bi or mono-planar X-ray(s) benchmark datasets show that proposed DX2CT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and model will be available at: https://www.github.com/intyeger/DX2CT."
Kinect Calibration and Data Optimization For Anthropometric Parameters,"Recently, through development of several 3d vision systems, widely used in various applications, medical and biometric fields. Microsoft kinect sensor have been most of used camera among 3d vision systems. Microsoft kinect sensor can obtain depth images of a scene and 3d coordinates of human joints. Thus, anthropometric features can extractable easily. Anthropometric feature and 3d joint coordinate raw datas which captured from kinect sensor is unstable. The strongest reason for this, datas vary by distance between joints of individual and location of kinect sensor. Consequently, usage of this datas without kinect calibration and data optimization does not result in sufficient and healthy. In this study, proposed a novel method to calibrating kinect sensor and optimizing skeleton features. Results indicate that the proposed method is quite effective and worthy of further study in more general scenarios."
FP-VEC: Fingerprinting Large Language Models via Efficient Vector Addition,"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data. As a result, protecting the intellectual property of these models through fingerprinting is essential for ownership authentication. While adding fingerprints to LLMs through fine-tuning has been attempted, it remains costly and unscalable. In this paper, we introduce FP-VEC, a pilot study on using fingerprint vectors as an efficient fingerprinting method for LLMs. Our approach generates a fingerprint vector that represents a confidential signature embedded in the model, allowing the same fingerprint to be seamlessly incorporated into an unlimited number of LLMs via vector addition. Results on several LLMs show that FP-VEC is lightweight by running on CPU-only devices for fingerprinting, scalable with a single training and unlimited fingerprinting process, and preserves the model's normal behavior. The project page is available at https://fingerprintvector.github.io ."
AIPO: Improving Training Objective for Iterative Preference Optimization,"Preference Optimization (PO), is gaining popularity as an alternative choice of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research on aligning LLMs iteratively with synthetic or partially synthetic data shows promising results in scaling up PO training for both academic settings and proprietary trained models such as Llama3. Despite its success, our study shows that the length exploitation issue present in PO is even more severe in Iterative Preference Optimization (IPO) due to the iterative nature of the process. In this work, we study iterative preference optimization with synthetic data. We share the findings and analysis along the way of building the iterative preference optimization pipeline. More specifically, we discuss the length exploitation issue during iterative preference optimization and propose our training objective for iterative preference optimization, namely Agreement-aware Iterative Preference Optimization (AIPO). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard. Our implementation and model checkpoints will be made available at https://github.com/bytedance/AIPO."
Direct-CP: Directed Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles via Proactive Attention,"Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to enhance an ego vehicle's field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods expand the ego vehicle's 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, which faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Direct-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle's directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8\% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5\% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks."
RF Challenge: The Data-Driven Radio Frequency Signal Separation Challenge,"This paper addresses the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a novel, data-driven approach that leverages state-of-the-art AI models. Traditionally, interference rejection algorithms are manually tailored to specific types of interference. This work introduces a more scalable data-driven solution and contains the following contributions. First, we present an insightful signal model that serves as a foundation for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. Second, we introduce the RF Challenge, a publicly available dataset featuring diverse RF signals along with code templates, which facilitates data-driven analysis of RF signal problems. Third, we propose novel AI-based rejection algorithms, specifically architectures like UNet and WaveNet, and evaluate their performance across eight different signal mixture types. These models demonstrate superior performance exceeding traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation by up to two orders of magnitude in bit-error rate. Fourth, we summarize the results from an open competition hosted at 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024) based on the RF Challenge, highlighting the significant potential for continued advancements in this area. Our findings underscore the promise of deep learning algorithms in mitigating interference, offering a strong foundation for future research."
Can Kans (re)discover predictive models for Direct-Drive Laser Fusion?,"The domain of laser fusion presents a unique and challenging predictive modeling application landscape for machine learning methods due to high problem complexity and limited training data. Data-driven approaches utilizing prescribed functional forms, inductive biases and physics-informed learning (PIL) schemes have been successful in the past for achieving desired generalization ability and model interpretation that aligns with physics expectations. In complex multi-physics application domains, however, it is not always obvious how architectural biases or discriminative penalties can be formulated. In this work, focusing on nuclear fusion energy using high powered lasers, we present the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to PIL for developing a new type of data-driven predictive model which is able to achieve high prediction accuracy and physics interpretability. A KAN based model, a MLP with PIL, and a baseline MLP model are compared in generalization ability and interpretation with a domain expert-derived symbolic regression model. Through empirical studies in this high physics complexity domain, we show that KANs can potentially provide benefits when developing predictive models for data-starved physics applications."
Breaking reCAPTCHAv2,"Our work examines the efficacy of employing advanced machine learning methods to solve captchas from Google's reCAPTCHAv2 system. We evaluate the effectiveness of automated systems in solving captchas by utilizing advanced YOLO models for image segmentation and classification. Our main result is that we can solve 100% of the captchas, while previous work only solved 68-71%. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is no significant difference in the number of challenges humans and bots must solve to pass the captchas in reCAPTCHAv2. This implies that current AI technologies can exploit advanced image-based captchas. We also look under the hood of reCAPTCHAv2, and find evidence that reCAPTCHAv2 is heavily based on cookie and browser history data when evaluating whether a user is human or not. The code is provided alongside this paper."
Community Fact-Checks Trigger Moral Outrage in Replies to Misleading Posts on Social Media,"Displaying community fact-checks is a promising approach to reduce engagement with misinformation on social media. However, how users respond to misleading content emotionally after community fact-checks are displayed on posts is unclear. Here, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally analyze changes in sentiments and (moral) emotions in replies to misleading posts following the display of community fact-checks. Our evaluation is based on a large-scale panel dataset comprising N=2,225,260 replies across 1841 source posts from X's Community Notes platform. We find that informing users about falsehoods through community fact-checks significantly increases negativity (by 7.3%), anger (by 13.2%), disgust (by 4.7%), and moral outrage (by 16.0%) in the corresponding replies. These results indicate that users perceive spreading misinformation as a violation of social norms and that those who spread misinformation should expect negative reactions once their content is debunked. We derive important implications for the design of community-based fact-checking systems."
Generalized Nearest Neighbor Decoding: General Input Constellation and a Case Study of Interference Suppression,"In this work, generalized nearest neighbor decoding (GNND), a recently proposed receiver architecture, is studied for channels under general input constellations, and multiuser uplink interference suppression is employed as a case study for demonstrating its potential. In essence, GNND generalizes the wellknown nearest neighbor decoding, by introducing a symbol-level memoryless processing step, which can be rendered seamlessly compatible with Gaussian channel-based decoders. First, criteria of the optimal GNND are derived for general input constellations, expressed in the form of conditional moments matching, thereby generalizing the prior work which has been confined to Gaussian input. Then, the optimal GNND is applied to the use case of multiuser uplink, for which the optimal GNND is shown to be capable of achieving information rates nearly identical to the channel mutual information. By contrast, the commonly used channel linearization (CL) approach incurs a noticeable rate loss. A coded modulation scheme is subsequently developed, aiming at implementing GNND using off-the-shelf channel codes, without requiring iterative message passing between demodulator and decoder. Through numerical experiments it is validated that the developed scheme significantly outperforms the CL-based scheme."
Flight Testing of Latch Valve with Lightweight LV-Servo Direct Drive Mechanism,"In the field of rocket technology, the latch valve assumes a pivotal role in regulating the flow of fuel gases and liquids to ensure the requisite energy supply. This project endeavors to innovate by replacing the conventional step motor mechanism with a servo motor for latch valve control. The selected servo motor, boasting a more compact form factor and reduced mass, aligns seamlessly with the project's overarching objectives. While servo motors offer myriad advantages, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the constraints of their maximum output torque to guarantee the latch valve's reliable operation. Furthermore, as a rocket ascends, it encounters significant fluctuations in internal temperature and pressure. Consequently, rigorous environmental testing becomes paramount to validate the servo motor's performance under these dynamic conditions, thus ensuring the latch valve's unwavering functionality. The project's primary focus lies in achieving substantial weight reduction through the implementation of a servo motor for latch valve control."
Pathfinder for Low-altitude Aircraft with Binary Neural Network,"A prior global topological map (e.g., the OpenStreetMap, OSM) can boost the performance of autonomous mapping by a ground mobile robot. However, the prior map is usually incomplete due to lacking labeling in partial paths. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an OSM maker using airborne sensors carried by low-altitude aircraft, where the core of the OSM maker is a novel efficient pathfinder approach based on LiDAR and camera data, i.e., a binary dual-stream road segmentation model. Specifically, a multi-scale feature extraction based on the UNet architecture is implemented for images and point clouds. To reduce the effect caused by the sparsity of point cloud, an attention-guided gated block is designed to integrate image and point-cloud features. For enhancing the efficiency of the model, we propose a binarization streamline to each model component, including a variant of vision transformer (ViT) architecture as the encoder of the image branch, and new focal and perception losses to optimize the model training. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our pathfinder method achieves SOTA accuracy with high efficiency in finding paths from the low-level airborne sensors, and we can create complete OSM prior maps based on the segmented road skeletons. Code and data are available at:https://github.com/IMRL/Pathfinder}{https://github.com/IMRL/Pathfinder."
AutoIRT: Calibrating Item Response Theory Models with Automated Machine Learning,"Item response theory (IRT) is a class of interpretable factor models that are widely used in computerized adaptive tests (CATs), such as language proficiency tests. Traditionally, these are fit using parametric mixed effects models on the probability of a test taker getting the correct answer to a test item (i.e., question). Neural net extensions of these models, such as BertIRT, require specialized architectures and parameter tuning. We propose a multistage fitting procedure that is compatible with out-of-the-box Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools. It is based on a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) outer loop with a two stage inner loop, which trains a non-parametric AutoML grade model using item features followed by an item specific parametric model. This greatly accelerates the modeling workflow for scoring tests. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to the Duolingo English Test, a high stakes, online English proficiency test. We show that the resulting model is typically more well calibrated, gets better predictive performance, and more accurate scores than existing methods (non-explanatory IRT models and explanatory IRT models like BERT-IRT). Along the way, we provide a brief survey of machine learning methods for calibration of item parameters for CATs."
A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering,"Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks."
Deep reinforcement learning for tracking a moving target in jellyfish-like swimming,"We develop a deep reinforcement learning method for training a jellyfish-like swimmer to effectively track a moving target in a two-dimensional flow. This swimmer is a flexible object equipped with a muscle model based on torsional springs. We employ a deep Q-network (DQN) that takes the swimmer's geometry and dynamic parameters as inputs, and outputs actions which are the forces applied to the swimmer. In particular, we introduce an action regulation to mitigate the interference from complex fluid-structure interactions. The goal of these actions is to navigate the swimmer to a target point in the shortest possible time. In the DQN training, the data on the swimmer's motions are obtained from simulations conducted using the immersed boundary method. During tracking a moving target, there is an inherent delay between the application of forces and the corresponding response of the swimmer's body due to hydrodynamic interactions between the shedding vortices and the swimmer's own locomotion. Our tests demonstrate that the swimmer, with the DQN agent and action regulation, is able to dynamically adjust its course based on its instantaneous state. This work extends the application scope of machine learning in controlling flexible objects within fluid environments."
Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment,"The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback."
Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-AI Collaboration: An Empirical Study with LLM-driven AI Agents in a Real-time Shared Workspace Task,"Theory of Mind (ToM) significantly impacts human collaboration and communication as a crucial capability to understand others. When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results' implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks."
TabKANet: Tabular Data Modelling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Transformer,"Tabular data is the most common type of data in real-life scenarios. In this study, we propose a method based on the TabKANet architecture, which utilizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to encode numerical features and merge them with categorical features, enabling unified modeling of tabular data on the Transformer architecture. This model demonstrates outstanding performance in six widely used binary classification tasks, suggesting that TabKANet has the potential to become a standard approach for tabular modeling, surpassing traditional neural networks. Furthermore, this research reveals the significant advantages of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network in encoding numerical features. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/tsinghuamedgao20/TabKANet."
Exploring SSL Discrete Tokens for Multilingual ASR,"With the advancement of Self-supervised Learning (SSL) in speech-related tasks, there has been growing interest in utilizing discrete tokens generated by SSL for automatic speech recognition (ASR), as they offer faster processing techniques. However, previous studies primarily focused on multilingual ASR with Fbank features or English ASR with discrete tokens, leaving a gap in adapting discrete tokens for multilingual ASR scenarios. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of discrete tokens generated by various leading SSL models across multiple language domains. We aim to explore the performance and efficiency of speech discrete tokens across multiple language domains for both monolingual and multilingual ASR scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that discrete tokens achieve comparable results against systems trained on Fbank features in ASR tasks across seven language domains with an average word error rate (WER) reduction of 0.31% and 1.76% absolute (2.80% and 15.70% relative) on dev and test sets respectively, with particularly WER reduction of 6.82% absolute (41.48% relative) on the Polish test set."
Task-Specific Data Preparation for Deep Learning to Reconstruct Structures of Interest from Severely Truncated CBCT Data,"Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in interventional surgeries and radiation oncology. Due to the limited size of flat-panel detectors, anatomical structures might be missing outside the limited field-of-view (FOV), which restricts the clinical applications of CBCT systems. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to extend the FOV for multi-slice CT systems. However, in mobile CBCT system with a smaller FOV size, projection data is severely truncated and it is challenging for a network to restore all missing structures outside the FOV. In some applications, only certain structures outside the FOV are of interest, e.g., ribs in needle path planning for liver/lung cancer diagnosis. Therefore, a task-specific data preparation method is proposed in this work, which automatically let the network focus on structures of interest instead of all the structures. Our preliminary experiment shows that Pix2pixGAN with a conventional training has the risk to reconstruct false positive and false negative rib structures from severely truncated CBCT data, whereas Pix2pixGAN with the proposed task-specific training can reconstruct all the ribs reliably. The proposed method is promising to empower CBCT with more clinical applications."
Graph grammars and Physics Informed Neural Networks for simulating of pollution propagation on Spitzbergen,"In this paper, we present two computational methods for performing simulations of pollution propagation described by advection-diffusion equations. The first method employs graph grammars to describe the generation process of the computational mesh used in simulations with the meshless solver of the three-dimensional finite element method. The graph transformation rules express the three-dimensional Rivara longest-edge refinement algorithm. This solver is used for an exemplary application: performing three-dimensional simulations of pollution generation by the coal-burning power plant and its propagation in the city of Longyearbyen, the capital of Spitsbergen. The second computational code is based on the Physics Informed Neural Networks method. It is used to calculate the dissipation of the pollution along the valley in which the city of Longyearbyen is located. We discuss the instantiation and execution of the PINN method using Google Colab implementation. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the PINN implementation."
Reading ability detection using eye-tracking data with LSTM-based few-shot learning,"Reading ability detection is important in modern educational field. In this paper, a method of predicting scores of reading ability is proposed, using the eye-tracking data of a few subjects (e.g., 68 subjects). The proposed method built a regression model for the score prediction by combining Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) and light-weighted neural networks. Experiments show that with few-shot learning strategy, the proposed method achieved higher accuracy than previous methods of score prediction in reading ability detection. The code can later be downloaded at https://github.com/pumpkinLNX/LSTM-eye-tracking-pytorch.git"
Exploring SSL Discrete Speech Features for Zipformer-based Contextual ASR,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) based discrete speech representations are highly compact and domain adaptable. In this paper, SSL discrete speech features extracted from WavLM models are used as additional cross-utterance acoustic context features in Zipformer-Transducer ASR systems. The efficacy of replacing Fbank features with discrete token features for modelling either cross-utterance contexts (from preceding and future segments), or current utterance's internal contexts alone, or both at the same time, are demonstrated thoroughly on the Gigaspeech 1000-hr corpus. The best Zipformer-Transducer system using discrete tokens based cross-utterance context features outperforms the baseline using utterance internal context only with statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of 0.32% to 0.41% absolute (2.78% to 3.54% relative) on the dev and test data. The lowest published WER of 11.15% and 11.14% were obtained on the dev and test sets. Our work is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/open-creator/icefall/tree/master/egs/gigaspeech/Context\_ASR."
LLaQo: Towards a Query-Based Coach in Expressive Music Performance Assessment,"Research in music understanding has extensively explored composition-level attributes such as key, genre, and instrumentation through advanced representations, leading to cross-modal applications using large language models. However, aspects of musical performance such as stylistic expression and technique remain underexplored, along with the potential of using large language models to enhance educational outcomes with customized feedback. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLaQo, a Large Language Query-based music coach that leverages audio language modeling to provide detailed and formative assessments of music performances. We also introduce instruction-tuned query-response datasets that cover a variety of performance dimensions from pitch accuracy to articulation, as well as contextual performance understanding (such as difficulty and performance techniques). Utilizing AudioMAE encoder and Vicuna-7b LLM backend, our model achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in predicting teachers' performance ratings, as well as in identifying piece difficulty and playing techniques. Textual responses from LLaQo was moreover rated significantly higher compared to other baseline models in a user study using audio-text matching. Our proposed model can thus provide informative answers to open-ended questions related to musical performance from audio data."
Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models,"Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow decay of singular values. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying a space-local POD within each subdomain, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D advection equation discretized using a central difference scheme. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps."
Optimizing Ingredient Substitution Using Large Language Models to Enhance Phytochemical Content in Recipes,"In the emerging field of computational gastronomy, aligning culinary practices with scientifically supported nutritional goals is increasingly important. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to optimize ingredient substitutions in recipes, specifically to enhance the phytochemical content of meals. Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants, which, based on preclinical studies, may offer potential health benefits. We fine-tuned models, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, DaVinci, and Meta's TinyLlama, using an ingredient substitution dataset. These models were used to predict substitutions that enhance phytochemical content and create a corresponding enriched recipe dataset. Our approach improved Hit@1 accuracy on ingredient substitution tasks, from the baseline 34.53 plus-minus 0.10% to 38.03 plus-minus 0.28% on the original GISMo dataset, and from 40.24 plus-minus 0.36% to 54.46 plus-minus 0.29% on a refined version of the same dataset. These substitutions led to the creation of 1,951 phytochemically enriched ingredient pairings and 1,639 unique recipes. While this approach demonstrates potential in optimizing ingredient substitutions, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions about health benefits, as the claims are based on preclinical evidence. Future work should include clinical validation and broader datasets to further evaluate the nutritional impact of these substitutions. This research represents a step forward in using AI to promote healthier eating practices, providing potential pathways for integrating computational methods with nutritional science."
Electrocardiogram Report Generation and Question Answering via Retrieval-Augmented Self-Supervised Modeling,"Interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and generating comprehensive reports remain challenging tasks in cardiology, often requiring specialized expertise and significant time investment. To address these critical issues, we propose ECG-ReGen, a retrieval-based approach for ECG-to-text report generation and question answering. Our method leverages a self-supervised learning for the ECG encoder, enabling efficient similarity searches and report retrieval. By combining pre-training with dynamic retrieval and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement, ECG-ReGen effectively analyzes ECG data and answers related queries, with the potential of improving patient care. Experiments conducted on the PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets demonstrate superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios for report generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits competitive performance on ECG-QA dataset compared to fully supervised methods when utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs for zero-shot question answering. This approach, effectively combining self-supervised encoder and LLMs, offers a scalable and efficient solution for accurate ECG interpretation, holding significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making."
Deep Learning-based Codes for Wiretap Fading Channels,"The wiretap channel is a well-studied problem in the physical layer security (PLS) literature. Although it is proven that the decoding error probability and information leakage can be made arbitrarily small in the asymptotic regime, further research on finite-blocklength codes is required on the path towards practical, secure communications systems. This work provides the first experimental characterization of a deep learning-based, finite-blocklength code construction for multi-tap fading wiretap channels without channel state information (CSI). In addition to the evaluation of the average probability of error and information leakage, we illustrate the influence of (i) the number of fading taps, (ii) differing variances of the fading coefficients and (iii) the seed selection for the hash function-based security layer."
Double Index Calculus Algorithm: Faster Solving Discrete Logarithm Problem in Finite Prime Field,"Solving the discrete logarithm problem in a finite prime field is an extremely important computing problem in modern cryptography. The hardness of solving the discrete logarithm problem in a finite prime field is the security foundation of numerous cryptography schemes. In this paper, we propose the double index calculus algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem in a finite prime field. Our algorithm is faster than the index calculus algorithm, which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem in a finite prime field. Empirical experiment results indicate that our algorithm could be more than a 30-fold increase in computing speed than the index calculus algorithm when the bit length of the order of prime field is 70 bits. In addition, our algorithm is more general than the index calculus algorithm. Specifically, when the base of the target discrete logarithm problem is not the multiplication generator, the index calculus algorithm may fail to solve the discrete logarithm problem while our algorithm still can work."
Contactless Fingerprint Recognition Using 3D Graph Matching,"Contactless fingerprint is a newly developed type of fingerprint, and has gained lots of attention in recent fingerprint studies. However, most existing contactless fingerprint algorithms treat contactless fingerprints as 2D plain fingerprints, and utilize similar recognition methods as traditional contact-based 2D fingerprints. This recognition approach does not consider the modality difference between contactless and contact fingerprints, especially the intrinsic 3D characteristic of contactless fingerprints. This paper proposes a novel contactless fingerprint recognition algorithm that captures the revealed 3D feature of contactless fingerprints rather than the plain 2D feature. The proposed method first recovers 3D features from the input contactless fingerprint, including the 3D shape model and 3D fingerprint feature (minutiae, orientation, etc.). Then, a novel 3D graph matching is conducted in 3D space according to the extracted 3D feature. Our method captures the real 3D nature of contactless fingerprints as the whole feature extraction and matching algorithms are completed in real 3D space. Experiments results on contactless fingerprint databases show that the proposed method successfully improves the matching accuracy of contactless fingerprints. Exceptionally, our method performs stably across multiple poses of contactless fingerprints due to 3D graph matching, which is a great advantage compared to previous contactless fingerprint recognition algorithms."
Community-based fact-checking reduces the spread of misleading posts on social media,"Community-based fact-checking is a promising approach to verify social media content and correct misleading posts at scale. Yet, causal evidence regarding its effectiveness in reducing the spread of misinformation on social media is missing. Here, we performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze whether community notes reduce the spread of misleading posts on X. Using a Difference-in-Differences design and repost time series data for N=237,677 (community fact-checked) cascades that had been reposted more than 431 million times, we found that exposing users to community notes reduced the spread of misleading posts by, on average, 62.0%. Furthermore, community notes increased the odds that users delete their misleading posts by 103.4%. However, our findings also suggest that community notes might be too slow to intervene in the early (and most viral) stage of the diffusion. Our work offers important implications to enhance the effectiveness of community-based fact-checking approaches on social media."
Sign Language Sense Disambiguation,"This project explores methods to enhance sign language translation of German sign language, specifically focusing on disambiguation of homonyms. Sign language is ambiguous and understudied which is the basis for our experiments. We approach the improvement by training transformer-based models on various bodypart representations to shift the focus on said bodypart. To determine the impact of, e.g., the hand or mouth representations, we experiment with different combinations. The results show that focusing on the mouth increases the performance in small dataset settings while shifting the focus on the hands retrieves better results in larger dataset settings. Our results contribute to better accessibility for non-hearing persons by improving the systems powering digital assistants, enabling a more accurate interaction. The code for this project can be found on GitHub."
What You Say = What You Want? Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements for LLMs,"Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting."
An Attack on $p$-adic Lattice Public-key Cryptosystems and Signature Schemes,"Lattices have many significant applications in cryptography. In 2021, the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem were introduced. They are based on the Longest Vector Problem (LVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) in $p$-adic lattices. These problems are considered to be challenging and there are no known deterministic polynomial time algorithms to solve them. In this paper, we improve the LVP algorithm in local fields. The modified LVP algorithm is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm when the field is totally ramified and $p$ is a polynomial in the rank of the input lattice. We utilize this algorithm to attack the above schemes so that we are able to forge a valid signature of any message and decrypt any ciphertext. Although these schemes are broken, this work does not mean that $p$-adic lattices are not suitable in constructing cryptographic primitives. We propose some possible modifications to avoid our attack at the end of this paper."
On the Computation of BD-Rate over a Set of Videos for Fair Assessment of Performance of Learned Video Codecs,"The Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta (BD) measure is widely employed to evaluate and quantify the variations in the rate-distortion(RD) performance across different codecs. Many researchers report the average BD value over multiple videos within a dataset for different codecs. We claim that the current practice in the learned video compression community of computing the average BD value over a dataset based on the average RD curve of multiple videos can lead to misleading conclusions. We show both by analysis of a simplistic case of linear RD curves and experimental results with two recent learned video codecs that averaging RD curves can lead to a single video to disproportionately influence the average BD value especially when the operating bitrate range of different codecs do not exactly match. Instead, we advocate for calculating the BD measure per-video basis, as commonly done by the traditional video compression community, followed by averaging the individual BD values over videos, to provide a fair comparison of learned video codecs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the comparison of two recent learned video codecs is affected by how we evaluate the average BD measure."
In-depth Analysis of Low-rank Matrix Factorisation in a Federated Setting,"We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on $N$ clients, each holding a local dataset $\mathbf{S}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, mathematically, we seek to solve $min_{\mathbf{U}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i\times r}, \mathbf{V}\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} } \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{S}^i - \mathbf{U}^i \mathbf{V}^\top\|^2_{\text{F}}$. Considering a power initialization of $\mathbf{V}$, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client $i$ in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, we obtain a global $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ common to all clients and a local variable $\mathbf{U}^i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times r}$. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on $\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{r}$, where $\sigma_{r}$ is the $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ singular value of the concatenation $\mathbf{S}$ of the matrices $(\mathbf{S}^i)_{i=1}^N$. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on $\sigma_{\max}^2 / \sigma_{\min}^2$. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data."
Increasing Both Batch Size and Learning Rate Accelerates Stochastic Gradient Descent,"The performance of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strongly depends on setting the batch size and learning rate to minimize the empirical loss in training the deep neural network. In this paper, we present theoretical analyses of mini-batch SGD with four schedulers: (i) constant batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (ii) increasing batch size and decaying learning rate scheduler, (iii) increasing batch size and increasing learning rate scheduler, and (iv) increasing batch size and warm-up decaying learning rate scheduler. We show that mini-batch SGD using scheduler (i) does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss, whereas it does using any of schedulers (ii), (iii), and (iv). Furthermore, schedulers (iii) and (iv) accelerate mini-batch SGD. The paper also provides numerical results of supporting analyses showing that using scheduler (iii) or (iv) minimizes the full gradient norm of the empirical loss faster than using scheduler (i) or (ii)."
Causal Transformer for Fusion and Pose Estimation in Deep Visual Inertial Odometry,"In recent years, transformer-based architectures become the de facto standard for sequence modeling in deep learning frameworks. Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ybkurt/VIFT."
Measure-Theoretic Time-Delay Embedding,"The celebrated Takens' embedding theorem provides a theoretical foundation for reconstructing the full state of a dynamical system from partial observations. However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we rigorously establish a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between probability spaces. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transportation theory. Building on our novel measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we have developed a new computational framework that forecasts the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with better robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our approach through several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to large-scale, real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature forecasting and ERA5 wind field reconstruction."
HOLA-Drone: Hypergraphic Open-ended Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Drone Cooperative Pursuit,"Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a significant challenge in multi-agent collaboration, aiming to develop agents that can coordinate with unseen partners they have not encountered before. Recent cutting-edge ZSC methods have primarily focused on two-player video games such as OverCooked!2 and Hanabi. In this paper, we extend the scope of ZSC research to the multi-drone cooperative pursuit scenario, exploring how to construct a drone agent capable of coordinating with multiple unseen partners to capture multiple evaders. We propose a novel Hypergraphic Open-ended Learning Algorithm (HOLA-Drone) that continuously adapts the learning objective based on our hypergraphic-form game modeling, aiming to improve cooperative abilities with multiple unknown drone teammates. To empirically verify the effectiveness of HOLA-Drone, we build two different unseen drone teammate pools to evaluate their performance in coordination with various unseen partners. The experimental results demonstrate that HOLA-Drone outperforms the baseline methods in coordination with unseen drone teammates. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the feasibility of HOLA-Drone in physical systems. Videos can be found on the project homepage~\url{https://sites.google.com/view/hola-drone}."
SAUC: Sparsity-Aware Uncertainty Calibration for Spatiotemporal Prediction with Graph Neural Networks,"Quantifying uncertainty is crucial for robust and reliable predictions. However, existing spatiotemporal deep learning mostly focuses on deterministic prediction, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in such prediction. Particularly, highly-granular spatiotemporal datasets are often sparse, posing extra challenges in prediction and uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel post-hoc Sparsity-awar Uncertainty Calibration (SAUC) framework, which calibrates uncertainty in both zero and non-zero values. To develop SAUC, we firstly modify the state-of-the-art deterministic spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) to probabilistic ones in the pre-calibration phase. Then we calibrate the probabilistic ST-GNNs for zero and non-zero values using quantile approaches.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SAUC can effectively fit the variance of sparse data and generalize across two real-world spatiotemporal datasets at various granularities. Specifically, our empirical experiments show a 20\% reduction in calibration errors in zero entries on the sparse traffic accident and urban crime prediction. Overall, this work demonstrates the theoretical and empirical values of the SAUC framework, thus bridging a significant gap between uncertainty quantification and spatiotemporal prediction."
Cross-Country Comparative Analysis of Climate Resilience and Localized Mapping in Data-Sparse Regions,"Climate resilience across sectors varies significantly in low-income countries (LICs), with agriculture being the most vulnerable to climate change. Existing studies typically focus on individual countries, offering limited insights into broader cross-country patterns of adaptation and vulnerability. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a framework for cross-country comparative analysis of sectoral climate resilience using meta-analysis and cross-country panel data techniques. The study identifies shared vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies across LICs, enabling more effective policy design. Additionally, a novel localized climate-agriculture mapping technique is developed, integrating sparse agricultural data with high-resolution satellite imagery to generate fine-grained maps of agricultural productivity under climate stress. Spatial interpolation methods, such as kriging, are used to address data gaps, providing detailed insights into regional agricultural productivity and resilience. The findings offer policymakers tools to prioritize climate adaptation efforts and optimize resource allocation both regionally and nationally."
Energy Consumption Trends in Sound Event Detection Systems,"Deep learning systems have become increasingly energy- and computation-intensive, raising concerns about their environmental impact. As organizers of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenge, we recognize the importance of addressing this issue. For the past three years, we have integrated energy consumption metrics into the evaluation of sound event detection (SED) systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of this energy criterion on the challenge results and explore the evolution of system complexity and energy consumption over the years. We highlight a shift towards more energy-efficient approaches during training without compromising performance, while the number of operations and system complexity continue to grow. Through this analysis, we hope to promote more environmentally friendly practices within the SED community."
Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks,"Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to ""complex systems"", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the non-deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded treewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds."
"Journalists, Emotions, and the Introduction of Generative AI Chatbots: A Large-Scale Analysis of Tweets Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT","As part of a broader look at the impact of generative AI, this study investigated the emotional responses of journalists to the release of ChatGPT at the time of its launch. By analyzing nearly 1 million Tweets from journalists at major U.S. news outlets, we tracked changes in emotional tone and sentiment before and after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Using various computational and natural language processing techniques to measure emotional shifts in response to ChatGPT's release, we found an increase in positive emotion and a more favorable tone post-launch, suggesting initial optimism toward AI's potential. This research underscores the pivotal role of journalists as interpreters of technological innovation and disruption, highlighting how their emotional reactions may shape public narratives around emerging technologies. The study contributes to understanding the intersection of journalism, emotion, and AI, offering insights into the broader societal impact of generative AI tools."
Online Network Inference from Graph-Stationary Signals with Hidden Nodes,"Graph learning is the fundamental task of estimating unknown graph connectivity from available data. Typical approaches assume that not only is all information available simultaneously but also that all nodes can be observed. However, in many real-world scenarios, data can neither be known completely nor obtained all at once. We present a novel method for online graph estimation that accounts for the presence of hidden nodes. We consider signals that are stationary on the underlying graph, which provides a model for the unknown connections to hidden nodes. We then formulate a convex optimization problem for graph learning from streaming, incomplete graph signals. We solve the proposed problem through an efficient proximal gradient algorithm that can run in real-time as data arrives sequentially. Additionally, we provide theoretical conditions under which our online algorithm is similar to batch-wise solutions. Through experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the viability of our approach for online graph learning in the presence of missing observations."
Cubature-based uncertainty estimation for nonlinear regression models,"Calibrating model parameters to measured data by minimizing loss functions is an important step in obtaining realistic predictions from model-based approaches, e.g., for process optimization. This is applicable to both knowledge-driven and data-driven model setups. Due to measurement errors, the calibrated model parameters also carry uncertainty. In this contribution, we use cubature formulas based on sparse grids to calculate the variance of the regression results. The number of cubature points is close to the theoretical minimum required for a given level of exactness. We present exact benchmark results, which we also compare to other cubatures. This scheme is then applied to estimate the prediction uncertainty of the NRTL model, calibrated to observations from different experimental designs."
Uncertainty Estimation by Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning,"Evidential deep learning (EDL) has shown remarkable success in uncertainty estimation. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and classification tasks. The limited OOD detection performance of EDL arises from its inability to reflect the distance between the testing example and training data when quantifying uncertainty, while its limited classification performance stems from its parameterization of the concentration parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning (DAEDL). DAEDL integrates the feature space density of the testing example with the output of EDL during the prediction stage, while using a novel parameterization that resolves the issues in the conventional parameterization. We prove that DAEDL enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties. DAEDL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks related to uncertainty estimation and classification"
A Hybrid Meta-Learning and Multi-Armed Bandit Approach for Context-Specific Multi-Objective Recommendation Optimization,"Recommender systems in online marketplaces face the challenge of balancing multiple objectives to satisfy various stakeholders, including customers, providers, and the platform itself. This paper introduces Juggler-MAB, a hybrid approach that combines meta-learning with Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) to address the limitations of existing multi-stakeholder recommendation systems. Our method extends the Juggler framework, which uses meta-learning to predict optimal weights for utility and compensation adjustments, by incorporating a MAB component for real-time, context-specific refinements. We present a two-stage approach where Juggler provides initial weight predictions, followed by MAB-based adjustments that adapt to rapid changes in user behavior and market conditions. Our system leverages contextual features such as device type and brand to make fine-grained weight adjustments based on specific segments. To evaluate our approach, we developed a simulation framework using a dataset of 0.6 million searches from Expedia's lodging booking platform. Results show that Juggler-MAB outperforms the original Juggler model across all metrics, with NDCG improvements of 2.9%, a 13.7% reduction in regret, and a 9.8% improvement in best arm selection rate."
A Grading Rubric for AI Safety Frameworks,"Over the past year, artificial intelligence (AI) companies have been increasingly adopting AI safety frameworks. These frameworks outline how companies intend to keep the potential risks associated with developing and deploying frontier AI systems to an acceptable level. Major players like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind have already published their frameworks, while another 13 companies have signaled their intent to release similar frameworks by February 2025. Given their central role in AI companies' efforts to identify and address unacceptable risks from their systems, AI safety frameworks warrant significant scrutiny. To enable governments, academia, and civil society to pass judgment on these frameworks, this paper proposes a grading rubric. The rubric consists of seven evaluation criteria and 21 indicators that concretize the criteria. Each criterion can be graded on a scale from A (gold standard) to F (substandard). The paper also suggests three methods for applying the rubric: surveys, Delphi studies, and audits. The purpose of the grading rubric is to enable nuanced comparisons between frameworks, identify potential areas of improvement, and promote a race to the top in responsible AI development."
DexSim2Real$^{2}$: Building Explicit World Model for Precise Articulated Object Dexterous Manipulation,"Articulated object manipulation is ubiquitous in daily life. In this paper, we present DexSim2Real$^{2}$, a novel robot learning framework for goal-conditioned articulated object manipulation using both two-finger grippers and multi-finger dexterous hands. The key of our framework is constructing an explicit world model of unseen articulated objects through active one-step interactions. This explicit world model enables sampling-based model predictive control to plan trajectories achieving different manipulation goals without needing human demonstrations or reinforcement learning. It first predicts an interaction motion using an affordance estimation network trained on self-supervised interaction data or videos of human manipulation from the internet. After executing this interaction on the real robot, the framework constructs a digital twin of the articulated object in simulation based on the two point clouds before and after the interaction. For dexterous multi-finger manipulation, we propose to utilize eigengrasp to reduce the high-dimensional action space, enabling more efficient trajectory searching. Extensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness for precise articulated object manipulation in both simulation and the real world using a two-finger gripper and a 16-DoF dexterous hand. The robust generalizability of the explicit world model also enables advanced manipulation strategies, such as manipulating with different tools."
Conforming finite element approximation for the fully-coupled non-linear thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model,"The Nernst-Planck model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the behavior of electrolyte systems. However, inherent deficiencies in this model have spurred the exploration of alternative approaches. In this context, this study presents simulation in multidimensional contexts for a new, fully-coupled, non-linear, thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model introduced by Dreyer et al. We present a robust mathematical formulation and employ a conforming finite element approximation to comprehensively explore both compressible and incompressible variants of the electrolyte mixture. Our investigation extends across diverse spatial dimensions, facilitating an in-depth analysis of parametric dependencies governing space-charge layer formation at boundaries under external voltage influence. Furthermore, meticulous consideration is given to finite ion size effects, which play a critical role in electrolyte flow dynamics. Insights from annular battery designs are also incorporated, which introduce unique dynamics to ion transport phenomena. Through rigorous simulations, we validate the accuracy and reliability of our numerical scheme, thereby laying the groundwork for an enhanced understanding and optimization of electrolyte system behaviors across various applications, notably in semiconductor devices and electrochemistry."
Uncertainty and Generalizability in Foundation Models for Earth Observation,"We take the perspective in which we want to design a downstream task (such as estimating vegetation coverage) on a certain area of interest (AOI) with a limited labeling budget. By leveraging an existing Foundation Model (FM) we must decide whether we train a downstream model on a different but label-rich AOI hoping it generalizes to our AOI, or we split labels in our AOI for training and validating. In either case, we face choices concerning what FM to use, how to sample our AOI for labeling, etc. which affect both the performance and uncertainty of the results. In this work, we perform a large ablative study using eight existing FMs on either Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 as input data, and the classes from the ESA World Cover product as downstream tasks across eleven AOIs. We do repeated sampling and training, resulting in an ablation of some 500K simple linear regression models. Our results show both the limits of spatial generalizability across AOIs and the power of FMs where we are able to get over 0.9 correlation coefficient between predictions and targets on different chip level predictive tasks. And still, performance and uncertainty vary greatly across AOIs, tasks and FMs. We believe this is a key issue in practice, because there are many design decisions behind each FM and downstream task (input modalities, sampling, architectures, pretraining, etc.) and usually a downstream task designer is aware of and can decide upon a few of them. Through this work, we advocate for the usage of the methodology herein described (large ablations on reference global labels and simple probes), both when publishing new FMs, and to make informed decisions when designing downstream tasks to use them."
Computation of $M$-QDR decomposition of tensors and applications,"The theory and computation of tensors with different tensor products play increasingly important roles in scientific computing and machine learning. Different products aim to preserve different algebraic properties from the matrix algebra, and the choice of tensor product determines the algorithms that can be directly applied. This study introduced a novel full-rank decomposition and $M$-$\mc{QDR}$ decomposition for third-order tensors based on $M$-product. Then, we designed algorithms for computing these two decompositions along with the Moore-Penrose inverse, and outer inverse of the tensors. In support of these theoretical results, a few numerical examples were discussed. In addition, we derive exact expressions for the outer inverses of tensors using symbolic tensor (tensors with polynomial entries) computation. We designed efficient algorithms to compute the Moore-Penrose inverse of symbolic tensors. The prowess of the proposed $M$-$\mc{QDR}$ decomposition for third-order tensors is applied to compress lossy color images."
Adaptive Sampling for Continuous Group Equivariant Neural Networks,"Steerable networks, which process data with intrinsic symmetries, often use Fourier-based nonlinearities that require sampling from the entire group, leading to a need for discretization in continuous groups. As the number of samples increases, both performance and equivariance improve, yet this also leads to higher computational costs. To address this, we introduce an adaptive sampling approach that dynamically adjusts the sampling process to the symmetries in the data, reducing the number of required group samples and lowering the computational demands. We explore various implementations and their effects on model performance, equivariance, and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate improved model performance, and a marginal increase in memory efficiency."
DataliVR: Transformation of Data Literacy Education through Virtual Reality with ChatGPT-Powered Enhancements,"Data literacy is essential in today's data-driven world, emphasizing individuals' abilities to effectively manage data and extract meaningful insights. However, traditional classroom-based educational approaches often struggle to fully address the multifaceted nature of data literacy. As education undergoes digital transformation, innovative technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) offer promising avenues for immersive and engaging learning experiences. This paper introduces DataliVR, a pioneering VR application aimed at enhancing the data literacy skills of university students within a contextual and gamified virtual learning environment. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embodied within a virtual avatar, DataliVR provides personalized learning assistance, enriching user learning experiences. Our study employed an experimental approach, with chatbot availability as the independent variable, analyzing learning experiences and outcomes as dependent variables with a sample of thirty participants. Our approach underscores the effectiveness and user-friendliness of ChatGPT-powered DataliVR in fostering data literacy skills. Moreover, our study examines the impact of the ChatGPT-based AI chatbot on users' learning, revealing significant effects on both learning experiences and outcomes. Our study presents a robust tool for fostering data literacy skills, contributing significantly to the digital advancement of data literacy education through cutting-edge VR and AI technologies. Moreover, our research provides valuable insights and implications for future research endeavors aiming to integrate LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) into educational VR platforms."
Applications of multiscale hierarchical decomposition to blind deconvolution,"The blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that is iteratively solving variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a non-blind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps."
Multi-intent Aware Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation,"Intent is a significant latent factor influencing user-item interaction sequences. Prevalent sequence recommendation models that utilize contrastive learning predominantly rely on single-intent representations to direct the training process. However, this paradigm oversimplifies real-world recommendation scenarios, attempting to encapsulate the diversity of intents within the single-intent level representation. SR models considering multi-intent information in their framework are more likely to reflect real-life recommendation scenarios accurately."
Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP,"Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/sklim84/NCDENow_CIKM2024."
DFADD: The Diffusion and Flow-Matching Based Audio Deepfake Dataset,"Mainstream zero-shot TTS production systems like Voicebox and Seed-TTS achieve human parity speech by leveraging Flow-matching and Diffusion models, respectively. Unfortunately, human-level audio synthesis leads to identity misuse and information security issues. Currently, many antispoofing models have been developed against deepfake audio. However, the efficacy of current state-of-the-art anti-spoofing models in countering audio synthesized by diffusion and flowmatching based TTS systems remains unknown. In this paper, we proposed the Diffusion and Flow-matching based Audio Deepfake (DFADD) dataset. The DFADD dataset collected the deepfake audio based on advanced diffusion and flowmatching TTS models. Additionally, we reveal that current anti-spoofing models lack sufficient robustness against highly human-like audio generated by diffusion and flow-matching TTS systems. The proposed DFADD dataset addresses this gap and provides a valuable resource for developing more resilient anti-spoofing models."
Accurate Computation of the Logarithm of Modified Bessel Functions on GPUs,"Bessel functions are critical in scientific computing for applications such as machine learning, protein structure modeling, and robotics. However, currently, available routines lack precision or fail for certain input ranges, such as when the order $v$ is large, and GPU-specific implementations are limited. We address the precision limitations of current numerical implementations while dramatically improving the runtime. We propose two novel algorithms for computing the logarithm of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds by computing intermediate values on a logarithmic scale. Our algorithms are robust and never have issues with underflows or overflows while having relative errors on the order of machine precision, even for inputs where existing libraries fail. In C++/CUDA, our algorithms have median and maximum speedups of 45x and 6150x for GPU and 17x and 3403x for CPU, respectively, over the ranges of inputs and third-party libraries tested. Compared to SciPy, the algorithms have median and maximum speedups of 77x and 300x for GPU and 35x and 98x for CPU, respectively, over the tested inputs.   The ability to robustly compute a solution and the low relative errors allow us to fit von Mises-Fisher, vMF, distributions to high-dimensional neural network features. This is, e.g., relevant for uncertainty quantification in metric learning. We obtain image feature data by processing CIFAR10 training images with the convolutional layers of a pre-trained ResNet50. We successfully fit vMF distributions to 2048-, 8192-, and 32768-dimensional image feature data using our algorithms. Our approach provides fast and accurate results while existing implementations in SciPy and mpmath fail to fit successfully.   Our approach is readily implementable on GPUs, and we provide a fast open-source implementation alongside this paper."
Disentangling the sources of cyber risk premia,"We use a methodology based on a machine learning algorithm to quantify firms' cyber risks based on their disclosures and a dedicated cyber corpus. The model can identify paragraphs related to determined cyber-threat types and accordingly attribute several related cyber scores to the firm. The cyber scores are unrelated to other firms' characteristics. Stocks with high cyber scores significantly outperform other stocks. The long-short cyber risk factors have positive risk premia, are robust to all factors' benchmarks, and help price returns. Furthermore, we suggest the market does not distinguish between different types of cyber risks but instead views them as a single, aggregate cyber risk."
Run supports and initial algebra supports of weighted automata,"We consider weighted automata over words and over trees where the weight algebras are strong bimonoids, i.e., semirings which may lack distributivity. It is well known that, for each such weighted automaton, its run semantics and its initial algebra semantics can be different, due to the presence of nondeterminism and the absence of distributivity. Here we investigate the question under which conditions on the strong bimonoid the support of the run semantics equals the support of the initial algebra semantics. We prove a characterization of this equality in terms of strongly zero-sum-free strong bimonoids (for weighted automata over words) and in terms of bi-strongly zero-sum-free strong bimonoids (for weighted automata over trees). We also consider shortly the images of the two semantics functions."
Quasimetric Value Functions with Dense Rewards,"As a generalization of reinforcement learning (RL) to parametrizable goals, goal conditioned RL (GCRL) has a broad range of applications, particularly in challenging tasks in robotics. Recent work has established that the optimal value function of GCRL $Q^\ast(s,a,g)$ has a quasimetric structure, leading to targetted neural architectures that respect such structure. However, the relevant analyses assume a sparse reward setting -- a known aggravating factor to sample complexity. We show that the key property underpinning a quasimetric, viz., the triangle inequality, is preserved under a dense reward setting as well. Contrary to earlier findings where dense rewards were shown to be detrimental to GCRL, we identify the key condition necessary for triangle inequality. Dense reward functions that satisfy this condition can only improve, never worsen, sample complexity. This opens up opportunities to train efficient neural architectures with dense rewards, compounding their benefits to sample complexity. We evaluate this proposal in 12 standard benchmark environments in GCRL featuring challenging continuous control tasks. Our empirical results confirm that training a quasimetric value function in our dense reward setting indeed outperforms training with sparse rewards."
Optimal Operation of a Building with Electricity-Heat Networks and Seasonal Storage,"As seasonal thermal energy storage emerges as an efficient solution to reduce CO2 emissions of buildings, challenges appear related to its optimal operation. In a system including short-term electricity storage, long-term heat storage, and where electricity and heat networks are connected through a heat pump, it becomes crucial to operate the system on two time scales. Based on real data from a university building, we simulate the operation of such a system over a year, comparing different strategies based on model predictive control (MPC). The first objective of this paper is to determine the minimum prediction horizon to retrieve the results of the full-horizon operation problem with cost minimization. The second objective is to evaluate a method that combines MPC with setting targets on the heat storage level at the end of the prediction horizon, based on historical data. For a prediction horizon of 6 days, the suboptimality gap with the full-horizon results is 4.31%, compared to 11.42% when using a prediction horizon of 42 days and fixing the final level to be equal to the initial level, which is a common approach."
Distilling Monolingual and Crosslingual Word-in-Context Representations,"In this study, we propose a method that distils representations of word meaning in context from a pre-trained masked language model in both monolingual and crosslingual settings. Word representations are the basis for context-aware lexical semantics and unsupervised semantic textual similarity (STS) estimation. Different from existing approaches, our method does not require human-annotated corpora nor updates of the parameters of the pre-trained model. The latter feature is appealing for practical scenarios where the off-the-shelf pre-trained model is a common asset among different applications. Specifically, our method learns to combine the outputs of different hidden layers of the pre-trained model using self-attention. Our auto-encoder based training only requires an automatically generated corpus. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we performed extensive experiments using various benchmark tasks. The results on the monolingual tasks confirmed that our representations exhibited a competitive performance compared to that of the previous study for the context-aware lexical semantic tasks and outperformed it for STS estimation. The results of the crosslingual tasks revealed that the proposed method largely improved crosslingual word representations of multilingual pre-trained models."
Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with LLM-based Agents,"In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability."
Layerwise Change of Knowledge in Neural Networks,"This paper aims to explain how a deep neural network (DNN) gradually extracts new knowledge and forgets noisy features through layers in forward propagation. Up to now, although the definition of knowledge encoded by the DNN has not reached a consensus, Previous studies have derived a series of mathematical evidence to take interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN. We extend the definition of interactions and, for the first time, extract interactions encoded by intermediate layers. We quantify and track the newly emerged interactions and the forgotten interactions in each layer during the forward propagation, which shed new light on the learning behavior of DNNs. The layer-wise change of interactions also reveals the change of the generalization capacity and instability of feature representations of a DNN."
Text-To-Speech Synthesis In The Wild,"Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are traditionally trained using modest databases of studio-quality, prompted or read speech collected in benign acoustic environments such as anechoic rooms. The recent literature nonetheless shows efforts to train TTS systems using data collected in the wild. While this approach allows for the use of massive quantities of natural speech, until now, there are no common datasets. We introduce the TTS In the Wild (TITW) dataset, the result of a fully automated pipeline, in this case, applied to the VoxCeleb1 dataset commonly used for speaker recognition. We further propose two training sets. TITW-Hard is derived from the transcription, segmentation, and selection of VoxCeleb1 source data. TITW-Easy is derived from the additional application of enhancement and additional data selection based on DNSMOS. We show that a number of recent TTS models can be trained successfully using TITW-Easy, but that it remains extremely challenging to produce similar results using TITW-Hard. Both the dataset and protocols are publicly available and support the benchmarking of TTS systems trained using TITW data."
Using Ear-EEG to Decode Auditory Attention in Multiple-speaker Environment,"Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) can help to determine the identity of the attended speaker during an auditory selective attention task, by analyzing and processing measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Most studies on AAD are based on scalp-EEG signals in two-speaker scenarios, which are far from real application. Ear-EEG has recently gained significant attention due to its motion tolerance and invisibility during data acquisition, making it easy to incorporate with other devices for applications. In this work, participants selectively attended to one of the four spatially separated speakers' speech in an anechoic room. The EEG data were concurrently collected from a scalp-EEG system and an ear-EEG system (cEEGrids). Temporal response functions (TRFs) and stimulus reconstruction (SR) were utilized using ear-EEG data. Results showed that the attended speech TRFs were stronger than each unattended speech and decoding accuracy was 41.3\% in the 60s (chance level of 25\%). To further investigate the impact of electrode placement and quantity, SR was utilized in both scalp-EEG and ear-EEG, revealing that while the number of electrodes had a minor effect, their positioning had a significant influence on the decoding accuracy. One kind of auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) method, STAnet, was testified with this ear-EEG database, resulting in 93.1% in 1-second decoding window. The implementation code and database for our work are available on GitHub: https://github.com/zhl486/Ear_EEG_code.git and Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10803261."
Towards Modified Condition/Decision Coverage of Rust,"Testing is an essential tool to assure software, especially so in safety-critical applications. To quantify how thoroughly a software item has been tested, a test coverage metric is required. Maybe the strictest such metric known in the safety critical systems is Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), which DO-178C prescribes for the highest software assurance level in aviation. In the past, ambiguities in the interpretation of MC/DC have been resolved already, i. e. in CAST-10. However, some central features of the Rust programming language necessitate further clarification. This work investigates aforementioned features, in particular pattern matching, providing a consistent view on how to apply MC/DC to Rust. Hence, this paper informs the implementation of Rust MC/DC tools, paving the road towards Rust in high-assurance applications."
L3Cube-IndicQuest: A Benchmark Questing Answering Dataset for Evaluating Knowledge of LLMs in Indic Context,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp ."
QueryCAD: Grounded Question Answering for CAD Models,"CAD models are widely used in industry and are essential for robotic automation processes. However, these models are rarely considered in novel AI-based approaches, such as the automatic synthesis of robot programs, as there are no readily available methods that would allow CAD models to be incorporated for the analysis, interpretation, or extraction of information. To address these limitations, we propose QueryCAD, the first system designed for CAD question answering, enabling the extraction of precise information from CAD models using natural language queries. QueryCAD incorporates SegCAD, an open-vocabulary instance segmentation model we developed to identify and select specific parts of the CAD model based on part descriptions. We further propose a CAD question answering benchmark to evaluate QueryCAD and establish a foundation for future research. Lastly, we integrate QueryCAD within an automatic robot program synthesis framework, validating its ability to enhance deep-learning solutions for robotics by enabling them to process CAD models (https://claudius-kienle.github.com/querycad)."
NeSHFS: Neighborhood Search with Heuristic-based Feature Selection for Click-Through Rate Prediction,"Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising and ad recommender systems. In the past decade, maximizing CTR has been the main focus of model development and solution creation. Therefore, researchers and practitioners have proposed various models and solutions to enhance the effectiveness of CTR prediction. Most of the existing literature focuses on capturing either implicit or explicit feature interactions. Although implicit interactions are successfully captured in some studies, explicit interactions present a challenge for achieving high CTR by extracting both low-order and high-order feature interactions. Unnecessary and irrelevant features may cause high computational time and low prediction performance. Furthermore, certain features may perform well with specific predictive models while underperforming with others. Also, feature distribution may fluctuate due to traffic variations. Most importantly, in live production environments, resources are limited, and the time for inference is just as crucial as training time. Because of all these reasons, feature selection is one of the most important factors in enhancing CTR prediction model performance. Simple filter-based feature selection algorithms do not perform well and they are not sufficient. An effective and efficient feature selection algorithm is needed to consistently filter the most useful features during live CTR prediction process. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm named Neighborhood Search with Heuristic-based Feature Selection (NeSHFS) to enhance CTR prediction performance while reducing dimensionality and training time costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed solution."
DM: Dual-path Magnitude Network for General Speech Restoration,"In this paper, we introduce a novel general speech restoration model: the Dual-path Magnitude (DM) network, designed to address multiple distortions including noise, reverberation, and bandwidth degradation effectively. The DM network employs dual parallel magnitude decoders that share parameters: one uses a masking-based algorithm for distortion removal and the other employs a mapping-based approach for speech restoration. A novel aspect of the DM network is the integration of the magnitude spectrogram output from the masking decoder into the mapping decoder through a skip connection, enhancing the overall restoration capability. This integrated approach overcomes the inherent limitations observed in previous models, as detailed in a step-by-step analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the DM network outperforms other baseline models in the comprehensive aspect of general speech restoration, achieving substantial restoration with fewer parameters."
Personalized Weight Loss Management through Wearable Devices and Artificial Intelligence,"Early detection of chronic and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) is crucial for effective treatment during the initial stages. This study explores the application of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in order to predict weight loss changes in overweight and obese individuals. Using wearable data from a 1-month trial involving around 100 subjects from the AI4FoodDB database, including biomarkers, vital signs, and behavioral data, we identify key differences between those achieving weight loss (>= 2% of their initial weight) and those who do not. Feature selection techniques and classification algorithms reveal promising results, with the Gradient Boosting classifier achieving 84.44% Area Under the Curve (AUC). The integration of multiple data sources (e.g., vital signs, physical and sleep activity, etc.) enhances performance, suggesting the potential of wearable devices and AI in personalized healthcare."
Precision Aquaculture: An Integrated Computer Vision and IoT Approach for Optimized Tilapia Feeding,"Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request."
B4: Towards Optimal Assessment of Plausible Code Solutions with Plausible Tests,"Selecting the best code solution from multiple generated ones is an essential task in code generation, which can be achieved by using some reliable validators (e.g., developer-written test cases) for assistance. Since reliable test cases are not always available and can be expensive to build in practice, researchers propose to automatically generate test cases to assess code solutions. However, when both code solutions and test cases are plausible and not reliable, selecting the best solution becomes challenging. Although some heuristic strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem, they lack a strong theoretical guarantee and it is still an open question whether an optimal selection strategy exists. Our work contributes in two ways. First, we show that within a Bayesian framework, the optimal selection strategy can be defined based on the posterior probability of the observed passing states between solutions and tests. The problem of identifying the best solution is then framed as an integer programming problem. Second, we propose an efficient approach for approximating this optimal (yet uncomputable) strategy, where the approximation error is bounded by the correctness of prior knowledge. We then incorporate effective prior knowledge to tailor code generation tasks. Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that existing heuristics are limited in selecting the best solutions with plausible test cases. Our proposed approximated optimal strategy B4 significantly surpasses existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-CTAG/B4."
Autoregressive Sequence Modeling for 3D Medical Image Representation,"Three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are essential for clinical applications. However, the need for diverse and comprehensive representations is particularly pronounced when considering the variability across different organs, diagnostic tasks, and imaging modalities. How to effectively interpret the intricate contextual information and extract meaningful insights from these images remains an open challenge to the community. While current self-supervised learning methods have shown potential, they often consider an image as a whole thereby overlooking the extensive, complex relationships among local regions from one or multiple images. In this work, we introduce a pioneering method for learning 3D medical image representations through an autoregressive pre-training framework. Our approach sequences various 3D medical images based on spatial, contrast, and semantic correlations, treating them as interconnected visual tokens within a token sequence. By employing an autoregressive sequence modeling task, we predict the next visual token in the sequence, which allows our model to deeply understand and integrate the contextual information inherent in 3D medical images. Additionally, we implement a random startup strategy to avoid overestimating token relationships and to enhance the robustness of learning. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the superior performance over others on nine downstream tasks in public datasets."
Generating Temporal Contact Graphs Using Random Walkers,"We study human mobility networks through timeseries of contacts between individuals. Our proposed Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model generates temporal graph sequences based on independent random walkers that traverse an underlying graph in discrete time steps. Co-location of walkers at a given node and time defines an individual-level contact. RWIG is shown to be a realistic model for temporal human contact graphs, which may place RWIG on a same footing as the Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models for fixed graphs. Moreover, RWIG is analytically feasible: we derive closed form solutions for the probability distribution of contact graphs."
GenMapping: Unleashing the Potential of Inverse Perspective Mapping for Robust Online HD Map Construction,"Online High-Definition (HD) maps have emerged as the preferred option for autonomous driving, overshadowing the counterpart offline HD maps due to flexible update capability and lower maintenance costs. However, contemporary online HD map models embed parameters of visual sensors into training, resulting in a significant decrease in generalization performance when applied to visual sensors with different parameters. Inspired by the inherent potential of Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM), where camera parameters are decoupled from the training process, we have designed a universal map generation framework, GenMapping. The framework is established with a triadic synergy architecture, including principal and dual auxiliary branches. When faced with a coarse road image with local distortion translated via IPM, the principal branch learns robust global features under the state space models. The two auxiliary branches are a dense perspective branch and a sparse prior branch. The former exploits the correlation information between static and moving objects, whereas the latter introduces the prior knowledge of OpenStreetMap (OSM). The triple-enhanced merging module is crafted to synergistically integrate the unique spatial features from all three branches. To further improve generalization capabilities, a Cross-View Map Learning (CVML) scheme is leveraged to realize joint learning within the common space. Additionally, a Bidirectional Data Augmentation (BiDA) module is introduced to mitigate reliance on datasets concurrently. A thorough array of experimental results shows that the proposed model surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both semantic mapping and vectorized mapping, while also maintaining a rapid inference speed. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/GenMapping."
xTED: Cross-Domain Policy Adaptation via Diffusion-Based Trajectory Editing,"Reusing pre-collected data from different domains is an attractive solution in decision-making tasks where the accessible data is insufficient in the target domain but relatively abundant in other related domains. Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments."
Robust Output Feedback of Nonlinear Systems through the Efficient Solution of Min-Max Optimization Problems,"We examine robust output feedback control of discrete-time nonlinear systems with bounded uncertainties affecting the dynamics and measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate how to construct semi-infinite programs that produce gains to minimize some desired performance cost over a finite prediction horizon for the worst-case realization of the system's uncertainties, while also ensuring that any specified nonlinear constraints are always satisfied. The solution process relies on an implicit description of the feasible state space through prior measurements and the system dynamics, and assumes that the system is always in the subset of the feasible space that is most detrimental to performance. In doing so, we can guarantee that the system's true state will meet all of the chosen performance criteria without resorting to any explicit state estimation. Under some smoothness assumptions, we also discuss solving these semi-infinite programs through local reduction techniques, which generate optimal scenario sets for the uncertainty realizations to approximate the continuous uncertainty space and speed up the computation of optima. When tested on a two-dimensional nonlinear quadrotor, the developed method achieves robust constraint satisfaction and tracking despite dealing with highly uncertain measurements and system dynamics."
SLIM: Scalable and Lightweight LiDAR Mapping in Urban Environments,"LiDAR point cloud maps are extensively utilized on roads for robot navigation due to their high consistency. However, dense point clouds face challenges of high memory consumption and reduced maintainability for long-term operations. In this study, we introduce SLIM, a scalable and lightweight mapping system for long-term LiDAR mapping in urban environments. The system begins by parameterizing structural point clouds into lines and planes. These lightweight and structural representations meet the requirements of map merging, pose graph optimization, and bundle adjustment, ensuring incremental management and local consistency. For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, and HeLiPR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization. Ultimately, with multi-session LiDAR data, the SLIM system provides a globally consistent map with low memory consumption (130 KB/km). We have made our code open-source to benefit the community."
NEST-RQ: Next Token Prediction for Speech Self-Supervised Pre-Training,"Speech self-supervised pre-training can effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks. However, previous self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for speech, such as HuBERT and BEST-RQ, focus on utilizing non-causal encoders with bidirectional context, and lack sufficient support for downstream streaming models. To address this issue, we introduce the next token prediction based speech pre-training method with random-projection quantizer (NEST-RQ). NEST-RQ employs causal encoders with only left context and uses next token prediction (NTP) as the training task. On the large-scale dataset, compared to BEST-RQ, the proposed NEST-RQ achieves comparable performance on non-streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) and better performance on streaming ASR. We also conduct analytical experiments in terms of the future context size of streaming ASR, the codebook quality of SSL and the model size of the encoder. In summary, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the NTP in speech SSL and provides empirical evidence and insights for speech SSL research."
Shadow Program Inversion with Differentiable Planning: A Framework for Unified Robot Program Parameter and Trajectory Optimization,"This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints. To that end, we introduce DGPMP2-ND, a differentiable collision-free motion planner for serial N-DoF kinematics, and integrate it into an iterative, gradient-based optimization approach for generic, parameterized robot program representations. SPI-DP allows first-order optimization of planned trajectories and program parameters with respect to objectives such as cycle time or smoothness subject to e.g. collision constraints, while enabling humans to understand, modify or even certify the optimized programs. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on two practical household and industrial applications."
Systematic analysis of requirements for socially acceptable service robots,"In modern society, service robots are increasingly recognized for their wide range of practical applications. In large and crowded social spaces, such as museums and hospitals, these robots are required to safely move in the environment while exhibiting user-friendly behavior. Ensuring the safe and socially acceptable operation of robots in such settings presents several challenges. To enhance the social acceptance in the design process of service robots, we present a systematic analysis of requirements, categorized into functional and non-functional. These requirements are further classified into different categories, with a single requirement potentially belonging to multiple categories. Finally, considering the specific case of a receptionist robotic agent, we discuss the requirements it should possess to ensure social acceptance."
Redesigning graph filter-based GNNs to relax the homophily assumption,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a workhorse approach for learning from data defined over irregular domains, typically by implicitly assuming that the data structure is represented by a homophilic graph. However, recent works have revealed that many relevant applications involve heterophilic data where the performance of GNNs can be notably compromised. To address this challenge, we present a simple yet effective architecture designed to mitigate the limitations of the homophily assumption. The proposed architecture reinterprets the role of graph filters in convolutional GNNs, resulting in a more general architecture while incorporating a stronger inductive bias than GNNs based on filter banks. The proposed convolutional layer enhances the expressive capacity of the architecture enabling it to learn from both homophilic and heterophilic data and preventing the issue of oversmoothing. From a theoretical standpoint, we show that the proposed architecture is permutation equivariant. Finally, we show that the proposed GNNs compares favorably relative to several state-of-the-art baselines in both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, showcasing its promising potential."
Observer-Based Control of Second-Order Multi-vehicle Systems in Bearing-Persistently Exciting Formations,"This paper proposes an observer-based formation tracking control approach for multi-vehicle systems with second-order motion dynamics, assuming that vehicles' relative or global position and velocity measurements are unavailable. It is assumed that all vehicles are equipped with sensors capable of sensing the bearings relative to neighboring vehicles and only one leader vehicle has access to its global position. Each vehicle estimates its absolute position and velocity using relative bearing measurements and the estimates of neighboring vehicles received over a communication network. A distributed observer-based controller is designed, relying only on bearing and acceleration measurements.   This work further explores the concept of the \textit{Bearing Persistently Exciting} (BPE) formation by proposing new algorithms for bearing-based localization and state estimation of second-order systems in centralized and decentralized manners. It also examines conditions on the desired formation to guarantee the exponential stability of distributed observer-based formation tracking controllers. In support of our theoretical results, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed observers as well as the observer-based tracking controllers."
Acoustic identification of individual animals with hierarchical contrastive learning,"Acoustic identification of individual animals (AIID) is closely related to audio-based species classification but requires a finer level of detail to distinguish between individual animals within the same species. In this work, we frame AIID as a hierarchical multi-label classification task and propose the use of hierarchy-aware loss functions to learn robust representations of individual identities that maintain the hierarchical relationships among species and taxa. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical embeddings not only enhance identification accuracy at the individual level but also at higher taxonomic levels, effectively preserving the hierarchical structure in the learned representations. By comparing our approach with non-hierarchical models, we highlight the advantage of enforcing this structure in the embedding space. Additionally, we extend the evaluation to the classification of novel individual classes, demonstrating the potential of our method in open-set classification scenarios."
AdR-Gaussian: Accelerating Gaussian Splatting with Adaptive Radius,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a recent explicit 3D representation that has achieved high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, the rasterization pipeline still suffers from unnecessary overhead resulting from avoidable serial Gaussian culling, and uneven load due to the distinct number of Gaussian to be rendered across pixels, which hinders wider promotion and application of 3DGS. In order to accelerate Gaussian splatting, we propose AdR-Gaussian, which moves part of serial culling in Render stage into the earlier Preprocess stage to enable parallel culling, employing adaptive radius to narrow the rendering pixel range for each Gaussian, and introduces a load balancing method to minimize thread waiting time during the pixel-parallel rendering. Our contributions are threefold, achieving a rendering speed of 310% while maintaining equivalent or even better quality than the state-of-the-art. Firstly, we propose to early cull Gaussian-Tile pairs of low splatting opacity based on an adaptive radius in the Gaussian-parallel Preprocess stage, which reduces the number of affected tile through the Gaussian bounding circle, thus reducing unnecessary overhead and achieving faster rendering speed. Secondly, we further propose early culling based on axis-aligned bounding box for Gaussian splatting, which achieves a more significant reduction in ineffective expenses by accurately calculating the Gaussian size in the 2D directions. Thirdly, we propose a balancing algorithm for pixel thread load, which compresses the information of heavy-load pixels to reduce thread waiting time, and enhance information of light-load pixels to hedge against rendering quality loss. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve the Gaussian Splatting rendering speed."
Test-time Training for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution,"The progress on Hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR) is still lagging behind the research of RGB image SR. HSIs usually have a high number of spectral bands, so accurately modeling spectral band interaction for HSI SR is hard. Also, training data for HSI SR is hard to obtain so the dataset is usually rather small. In this work, we propose a new test-time training method to tackle this problem. Specifically, a novel self-training framework is developed, where more accurate pseudo-labels and more accurate LR-HR relationships are generated so that the model can be further trained with them to improve performance. In order to better support our test-time training method, we also propose a new network architecture to learn HSI SR without modeling spectral band interaction and propose a new data augmentation method Spectral Mixup to increase the diversity of the training data at test time. We also collect a new HSI dataset with a diverse set of images of interesting objects ranging from food to vegetation, to materials, and to general scenes. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that our method can improve the performance of pre-trained models significantly after test-time training and outperform competing methods significantly for HSI SR."
"Towards certifiable AI in aviation: landscape, challenges, and opportunities","Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are powerful tools for various domains, including critical fields such as avionics, where certification is required to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of safety. General solutions for safety-critical systems must address three main questions: Is it suitable? What drives the system's decisions? Is it robust to errors/attacks? This is more complex in AI than in traditional methods. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive mind map of formal AI certification in avionics. It highlights the challenges of certifying AI development with an example to emphasize the need for qualification beyond performance metrics."
Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles,"Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focus on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with a output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental condition to decide constraints states for final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously."
Investigating Disentanglement in a Phoneme-level Speech Codec for Prosody Modeling,"Most of the prevalent approaches in speech prosody modeling rely on learning global style representations in a continuous latent space which encode and transfer the attributes of reference speech. However, recent work on neural codecs which are based on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) already shows great potential offering distinct advantages. We investigate the prosody modeling capabilities of the discrete space of such an RVQ-VAE model, modifying it to operate on the phoneme-level. We condition both the encoder and decoder of the model on linguistic representations and apply a global speaker embedding in order to factor out both phonetic and speaker information. We conduct an extensive set of investigations based on subjective experiments and objective measures to show that the phoneme-level discrete latent representations obtained this way achieves a high degree of disentanglement, capturing fine-grained prosodic information that is robust and transferable. The latent space turns out to have interpretable structure with its principal components corresponding to pitch and energy."
Online Learning Of Expanding Graphs,"This paper addresses the problem of online network topology inference for expanding graphs from a stream of spatiotemporal signals. Online algorithms for dynamic graph learning are crucial in delay-sensitive applications or when changes in topology occur rapidly. While existing works focus on inferring the connectivity within a fixed set of nodes, in practice, the graph can grow as new nodes join the network. This poses additional challenges like modeling temporal dynamics involving signals and graphs of different sizes. This growth also increases the computational complexity of the learning process, which may become prohibitive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this setting. We propose a general online algorithm based on projected proximal gradient descent that accounts for the increasing graph size at each iteration. Recursively updating the sample covariance matrix is a key aspect of our approach. We introduce a strategy that enables different types of updates for nodes that just joined the network and for previously existing nodes. To provide further insights into the proposed method, we specialize it in Gaussian Markov random field settings, where we analyze the computational complexity and characterize the dynamic cumulative regret. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both controlled experiments and real-world datasets from epidemic and financial networks."
Promoting Fairness in Link Prediction with Graph Enhancement,"Link prediction is a crucial task in network analysis, but it has been shown to be prone to biased predictions, particularly when links are unfairly predicted between nodes from different sensitive groups. In this paper, we study the fair link prediction problem, which aims to ensure that the predicted link probability is independent of the sensitive attributes of the connected nodes. Existing methods typically incorporate debiasing techniques within graph embeddings to mitigate this issue. However, training on large real-world graphs is already challenging, and adding fairness constraints can further complicate the process. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairLink, a method that learns a fairness-enhanced graph to bypass the need for debiasing during the link predictor's training. FairLink maintains link prediction accuracy by ensuring that the enhanced graph follows a training trajectory similar to that of the original input graph. Meanwhile, it enhances fairness by minimizing the absolute difference in link probabilities between node pairs within the same sensitive group and those between node pairs from different sensitive groups. Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graphs demonstrate that FairLink not only promotes fairness but also often achieves link prediction accuracy comparable to baseline methods. Most importantly, the enhanced graph exhibits strong generalizability across different GNN architectures."
LMAC-TD: Producing Time Domain Explanations for Audio Classifiers,"Neural networks are typically black-boxes that remain opaque with regards to their decision mechanisms. Several works in the literature have proposed post-hoc explanation methods to alleviate this issue. This paper proposes LMAC-TD, a post-hoc explanation method that trains a decoder to produce explanations directly in the time domain. This methodology builds upon the foundation of L-MAC, Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers, a method that produces faithful and listenable explanations. We incorporate SepFormer, a popular transformer-based time-domain source separation architecture. We show through a user study that LMAC-TD significantly improves the audio quality of the produced explanations while not sacrificing from faithfulness."
Payments Use Cases and Design Options for Interoperability and Funds Locking across Digital Pounds and Commercial Bank Money,"Central banks are actively exploring retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), with the Bank of England currently in the design phase for a potential UK retail CBDC, the digital pound. In a previous paper, we defined and explored the important concept of functional consistency (which is the principle that different forms of money have the same operational characteristics) and evaluated design options to support functional consistency across digital pounds and commercial bank money, based on a set of key capabilities. In this paper, we continue to analyse the design options for supporting functional consistency and, in order to perform a detailed analysis, we focus on three key capabilities: communication between digital pound ecosystem participants, funds locking, and interoperability across digital pounds and commercial bank money. We explore these key capabilities via three payments use cases: person-to-person push payment, merchant-initiated request to pay, and lock funds and pay on physical delivery. We then present and evaluate the suitability of design options to provide the specific capabilities for each use case and draw initial insights. We conclude that a financial market infrastructure (FMI) providing specific capabilities could simplify the experience of ecosystem participants, simplify the operating platforms for both the Bank of England and digital pound Payment Interface Providers (PIPs), and facilitate the creation of innovative services. We also identify potential next steps."
SkinFormer: Learning Statistical Texture Representation with Transformer for Skin Lesion Segmentation,"Accurate skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images is of great importance for skin cancer diagnosis. However, automatic segmentation of melanoma remains a challenging task because it is difficult to incorporate useful texture representations into the learning process. Texture representations are not only related to the local structural information learned by CNN, but also include the global statistical texture information of the input image. In this paper, we propose a trans\textbf{Former} network (\textbf{SkinFormer}) that efficiently extracts and fuses statistical texture representation for \textbf{Skin} lesion segmentation. Specifically, to quantify the statistical texture of input features, a Kurtosis-guided Statistical Counting Operator is designed. We propose Statistical Texture Fusion Transformer and Statistical Texture Enhance Transformer with the help of Kurtosis-guided Statistical Counting Operator by utilizing the transformer's global attention mechanism. The former fuses structural texture information and statistical texture information, and the latter enhances the statistical texture of multi-scale features. {Extensive experiments on three publicly available skin lesion datasets validate that our SkinFormer outperforms other SOAT methods, and our method achieves 93.2\% Dice score on ISIC 2018. It can be easy to extend SkinFormer to segment 3D images in the future.} Our code is available at https://github.com/Rongtao-Xu/SkinFormer."
Switching Sampling Space of Model Predictive Path-Integral Controller to Balance Efficiency and Safety in 4WIDS Vehicle Navigation,"Four-wheel independent drive and steering vehicle (4WIDS Vehicle, Swerve Drive Robot) has the ability to move in any direction by its eight degrees of freedom (DoF) control inputs. Although the high maneuverability enables efficient navigation in narrow spaces, obtaining the optimal command is challenging due to the high dimension of the solution space. This paper presents a navigation architecture using the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control algorithm to avoid collisions with obstacles of any shape and reach a goal point. The key idea to make the problem easier is to explore the optimal control input in a reasonably reduced dimension that is adequate for navigation. Through evaluation in simulation, we found that selecting the sampling space of MPPI greatly affects navigation performance. In addition, our proposed controller which switches multiple sampling spaces according to the real-time situation can achieve balanced behavior between efficiency and safety. Source code is available at https://github.com/MizuhoAOKI/mppi_swerve_drive_ros"
Training Gradient Boosted Decision Trees on Tabular Data Containing Label Noise for Classification Tasks,"Label noise refers to the phenomenon where instances in a data set are assigned to the wrong label. Label noise is harmful to classifier performance, increases model complexity and impairs feature selection. Addressing label noise is crucial, yet current research primarily focuses on image and text data using deep neural networks. This leaves a gap in the study of tabular data and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs), the leading algorithm for tabular data. Different methods have already been developed which either try to filter label noise, model label noise while simultaneously training a classifier or use learning algorithms which remain effective even if label noise is present. This study aims to further investigate the effects of label noise on gradient-boosted decision trees and methods to mitigate those effects. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, the implemented methods demonstrate state-of-the-art noise detection performance on the Adult dataset and achieve the highest classification precision and recall on the Adult and Breast Cancer datasets, respectively. In summary, this paper enhances the understanding of the impact of label noise on GBDTs and lays the groundwork for future research in noise detection and correction methods."
CPL: Critical Planning Step Learning Boosts LLM Generalization in Reasoning Tasks,"Post-training large language models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities has proven effective across diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on improving task-specific reasoning but have not adequately addressed the model's generalization capabilities across a broader range of reasoning tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Critical Planning Step Learning (CPL), which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse planning steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. Based on long-term outcomes, CPL learns step-level planning preferences to improve the model's planning capabilities and, consequently, its general reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, while effective in many scenarios for aligning LLMs, existing preference learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to their inability to capture fine-grained supervision at each step. We propose Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates an advantage estimate for step-level preference pairs obtained via MCTS into the DPO. This enables the model to more effectively learn critical intermediate planning steps, thereby further improving its generalization in reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as ARC-C (+4.0%), BBH (+1.8%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and MMLU (+0.9%)."
Developing an Algorithm Selector for Green Configuration in Scheduling Problems,"The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is central to operations research, primarily optimizing energy efficiency due to its profound environmental and economic implications. Efficient scheduling enhances production metrics and mitigates energy consumption, thus effectively balancing productivity and sustainability objectives. Given the intricate and diverse nature of JSP instances, along with the array of algorithms developed to tackle these challenges, an intelligent algorithm selection tool becomes paramount. This paper introduces a framework designed to identify key problem features that characterize its complexity and guide the selection of suitable algorithms. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost, the framework recommends optimal solvers such as GUROBI, CPLEX, and GECODE for efficient JSP scheduling. GUROBI excels with smaller instances, while GECODE demonstrates robust scalability for complex scenarios. The proposed algorithm selector achieves an accuracy of 84.51\% in recommending the best algorithm for solving new JSP instances, highlighting its efficacy in algorithm selection. By refining feature extraction methodologies, the framework aims to broaden its applicability across diverse JSP scenarios, thereby advancing efficiency and sustainability in manufacturing logistics."
Byzantine-Robust and Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning via Compressed Momentum Filtering,"Distributed learning has become the standard approach for training large-scale machine learning models across private data silos. While distributed learning enhances privacy preservation and training efficiency, it faces critical challenges related to Byzantine robustness and communication reduction. Existing Byzantine-robust and communication-efficient methods rely on full gradient information either at every iteration or at certain iterations with a probability, and they only converge to an unnecessarily large neighborhood around the solution. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust and communication-efficient stochastic distributed learning method that imposes no requirements on batch size and converges to a smaller neighborhood around the optimal solution than all existing methods, aligning with the theoretical lower bound. Our key innovation is leveraging Polyak Momentum to mitigate the noise caused by both biased compressors and stochastic gradients, thus defending against Byzantine workers under information compression. We provide proof of tight complexity bounds for our algorithm in the context of non-convex smooth loss functions, demonstrating that these bounds match the lower bounds in Byzantine-free scenarios. Finally, we validate the practical significance of our algorithm through an extensive series of experiments, benchmarking its performance on both binary classification and image classification tasks."
Optimizing electric vehicles charging through smart energy allocation and cost-saving,"As the global focus on combating environmental pollution intensifies, the transition to sustainable energy sources, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EVs), has become paramount. This paper addresses the pressing need for Smart Charging for EVs by developing a comprehensive mathematical model aimed at optimizing charging station management. The model aims to efficiently allocate the power from charging sockets to EVs, prioritizing cost minimization and avoiding energy waste. Computational simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the mathematical optimization model, which can unleash its full potential when the number of EVs at the charging station is high."
Utilizing Data Fingerprints for Privacy-Preserving Algorithm Selection in Time Series Classification: Performance and Uncertainty Estimation on Unseen Datasets,"The selection of algorithms is a crucial step in designing AI services for real-world time series classification use cases. Traditional methods such as neural architecture search, automated machine learning, combined algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimizations are effective but require considerable computational resources and necessitate access to all data points to run their optimizations. In this work, we introduce a novel data fingerprint that describes any time series classification dataset in a privacy-preserving manner and provides insight into the algorithm selection problem without requiring training on the (unseen) dataset. By decomposing the multi-target regression problem, only our data fingerprints are used to estimate algorithm performance and uncertainty in a scalable and adaptable manner. Our approach is evaluated on the 112 University of California riverside benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the performance of 35 state-of-the-art algorithms and providing valuable insights for effective algorithm selection in time series classification service systems, improving a naive baseline by 7.32% on average in estimating the mean performance and 15.81% in estimating the uncertainty."
Average Consensus over Directed Networks in Open Multi-Agent Systems with Acknowledgement Feedback,"In this paper, we address the distributed average consensus problem over directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where the stability of the network is disrupted by frequent agent arrivals and departures, leading to a time-varying average consensus target. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel ratio consensus algorithm (OPENRC) based on acknowledgement feedback, designed to be robust to agent arrivals and departures, as well as to unbalanced directed network topologies. We demonstrate that when all active agents execute the OPENRC algorithm, the sum of their state variables remains constant during quiescent epochs when the network remains unchanged. By assuming eventual convergence during such quiescent periods following persistent variations in system composition and size, we prove the convergence of the OPENRC algorithm using column-stochasticity and mass-preservation properties. Finally, we apply and evaluate our proposed algorithm in a simulated environment, where agents are departing from and arriving in the network to highlight its resilience against changes in the network size and topology."
Improving Analog Neural Network Robustness: A Noise-Agnostic Approach with Explainable Regularizations,"This work tackles the critical challenge of mitigating ""hardware noise"" in deep analog neural networks, a major obstacle in advancing analog signal processing devices. We propose a comprehensive, hardware-agnostic solution to address both correlated and uncorrelated noise affecting the activation layers of deep neural models. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to demystify the ""black box"" nature of noise-resilient networks by revealing the underlying mechanisms that reduce sensitivity to noise. In doing so, we introduce a new explainable regularization framework that harnesses these mechanisms to significantly enhance noise robustness in deep neural architectures."
Sybil Detection using Graph Neural Networks,"This paper presents SYBILGAT, a novel approach to Sybil detection in social networks using Graph Attention Networks (GATs). Traditional methods for Sybil detection primarily leverage structural properties of networks; however, they tend to struggle with a large number of attack edges and are often unable to simultaneously utilize both known Sybil and honest nodes. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by dynamically assigning attention weights to different nodes during aggregations, enhancing detection performance. We conducted extensive experiments in various scenarios, including pretraining in sampled subgraphs, synthetic networks, and networks under targeted attacks. The results show that SYBILGAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in scenarios with high attack complexity and when the number of attack edges increases. Our approach shows robust performance across different network models and sizes, even as the detection task becomes more challenging. We successfully applied the model to a real-world Twitter graph with more than 269k nodes and 6.8M edges. The flexibility and generalizability of SYBILGAT make it a promising tool to defend against Sybil attacks in online social networks with only structural information."
Rhythmic Foley: A Framework For Seamless Audio-Visual Alignment In Video-to-Audio Synthesis,"Our research introduces an innovative framework for video-to-audio synthesis, which solves the problems of audio-video desynchronization and semantic loss in the audio. By incorporating a semantic alignment adapter and a temporal synchronization adapter, our method significantly improves semantic integrity and the precision of beat point synchronization, particularly in fast-paced action sequences. Utilizing a contrastive audio-visual pre-trained encoder, our model is trained with video and high-quality audio data, improving the quality of the generated audio. This dual-adapter approach empowers users with enhanced control over audio semantics and beat effects, allowing the adjustment of the controller to achieve better results. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our framework in achieving seamless audio-visual alignment."
Convex Reformulation of Information Constrained Linear State Estimation with Mixed-Binary Variables for Outlier Accommodation,"This article considers the challenge of accommodating outlier measurements in state estimation. The Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation approach addresses outliers as a measurement selection Bayesian risk minimization problem subject to an information accuracy constraint, which is a non-convex optimization problem. Prior explorations into RAPS rely on exhaustive search, which becomes computationally infeasible as the number of measurements increases. This paper derives a convex formulation for the RAPS optimization problems via transforming the mixed-binary variables into linear constraints. The convex reformulation herein can be solved by convex programming toolboxes, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. We explore two specifications: Full-RAPS, utilizing the full information matrix, and Diag-RAPS, focusing on diagonal elements only. The simulation comparison demonstrates that Diag-RAPS is faster and more efficient than Full-RAPS. In comparison with Kalman Filter (KF) and Threshold Decisions (TD), Diag-RAPS consistently achieves the lowest risk, while achieving the performance specification when it is feasible."
Global Minimum Energy State Estimation for Embedded Nonlinear Systems with Symmetry,"Choosing a nonlinear state estimator for an application often involves a trade-off between local optimality (such as provided by an extended Kalman filter) and (almost-/semi-) global asymptotic stability (such as provided by a constructive observer design based on Lyapunov principles). This paper proposes a filter design methodology that is both global and optimal for a class of nonlinear systems. In particular, systems for which there is an embedding of the state-manifold into Euclidean space for which the measurement function is linear in the embedding space and for which there is a synchronous error construction. A novel observer is derived using the minimum energy filter design paradigm and exploiting the embedding coordinates to solve for the globally optimal solution exactly. The observer is demonstrated through an application to the problem of unit quaternion attitude estimation, by embedding the 3-dimensional nonlinear system into a 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Simulation results demonstrate that the state estimate remains optimal for all time and converges even with a very large initial error."
Policy Prototyping for LLMs: Pluralistic Alignment via Interactive and Collaborative Policymaking,"Emerging efforts in AI alignment seek to broaden participation in shaping model behavior by eliciting and integrating collective input into a policy for model finetuning. While pluralistic, these processes are often linear and do not allow participating stakeholders to confirm whether potential outcomes of their contributions are indeed consistent with their intentions. Design prototyping has long advocated for rapid iteration using tight feedback loops of ideation, experimentation, and evaluation to mitigate these issues. We thus propose policy prototyping for LLMs, a new process that draws inspiration from prototyping practices to enable stakeholders to collaboratively and interactively draft LLM policies. Through learnings from a real-world LLM policymaking initiative at an industrial AI lab, we motivate our approach and characterize policy prototyping with four guiding principles. Because policy prototyping emphasizes a contrasting set of priorities compared to previous approaches, we envision our approach to be a valuable addition to the methodological repertoire for pluralistic alignment."
Co-Optimization of Robot Design and Control: Enhancing Performance and Understanding Design Complexity,"The design (shape) of a robot is usually decided before the control is implemented. This might limit how well the design is adapted to a task, as the suitability of the design is given by how well the robot performs in the task, which requires both a design and a controller. The co-optimization or simultaneous optimization of the design and control of robots addresses this limitation by producing a design and control that are both adapted to the task. In this paper, we investigate some of the challenges inherent in the co-optimization of design and control. We show that retraining the controller of a robot with additional resources after the co-optimization process terminates significantly improves the robot's performance. In addition, we demonstrate that the resources allocated to training the controller for each design influence the design complexity, where simpler designs are associated with lower training budgets. The experimentation is conducted in four publicly available simulation environments for co-optimization of design and control, making the findings more applicable to the general case. The results presented in this paper hope to guide other practitioners in the co-optimization of design and control of robots."
Joint image reconstruction and segmentation of real-time cardiac MRI in free-breathing using a model based on disentangled representation learning,"A joint image reconstruction and segmentation approach based on disentangled representation learning was trained to enable cardiac cine MR imaging in real-time and under free-breathing. An exploratory feasibility study tested the proposed method in undersampled real-time acquisitions based on an in-house developed spiral bSSFP pulse sequence in eight healthy participants and five patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation. Images and predicted LV segmentations were compared to the reference standard of ECG-gated segmented Cartesian cine in repeated breath-holds and corresponding manual segmentation. On a 5-point Likert scale, image quality of the real-time breath-hold approach and Cartesian cine was comparable in healthy participants (RT-BH: 1.99 $\pm$ .98, Cartesian: 1.94 $\pm$ .86, p=.052), but slightly inferior in free-breathing (RT-FB: 2.40 $\pm$ .98, p<.001). In patients with arrhythmia, image quality from both real-time approaches was favourable (RT-BH: 2.10 $\pm$ 1.28, p<.001, RT-FB: 2.40 $\pm$ 1.13, p<.001, Cartesian: 2.68 $\pm$ 1.13). Intra-observer reliability was good (ICC=.77, 95%-confidence interval [.75, .79], p<.001). In functional analysis, a positive bias was observed for ejection fractions derived from the proposed model compared to the clinical reference standard (RT-BH mean EF: 58.5 $\pm$ 5.6%, bias: +3.47%, 95%-confidence interval [-.86, 7.79%], RT-FB mean: 57.9 $\pm$ 10.6%, bias: +1.45%, [-3.02, 5.91%], Cartesian mean: 54.9 $\pm$ 6.7%). The introduced real-time MR imaging technique is capable of acquiring high-quality cardiac cine data in 1-2 minutes without the need for ECG gating and breath-holds. It thus offers a promising alternative to the current clinical practice of segmented acquisition, with shorter scan times, higher patient comfort and increased robustness to arrhythmia and patient incompliance."
TapToTab : Video-Based Guitar Tabs Generation using AI and Audio Analysis,"The automation of guitar tablature generation from video inputs holds significant promise for enhancing music education, transcription accuracy, and performance analysis. Existing methods face challenges with consistency and completeness, particularly in detecting fretboards and accurately identifying notes. To address these issues, this paper introduces an advanced approach leveraging deep learning, specifically YOLO models for real-time fretboard detection, and Fourier Transform-based audio analysis for precise note identification. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness compared to traditional techniques. This paper outlines the development, implementation, and evaluation of these methodologies, aiming to revolutionize guitar instruction by automating the creation of guitar tabs from video recordings."
DrawingSpinUp: 3D Animation from Single Character Drawings,"Animating various character drawings is an engaging visual content creation task. Given a single character drawing, existing animation methods are limited to flat 2D motions and thus lack 3D effects. An alternative solution is to reconstruct a 3D model from a character drawing as a proxy and then retarget 3D motion data onto it. However, the existing image-to-3D methods could not work well for amateur character drawings in terms of appearance and geometry. We observe the contour lines, commonly existing in character drawings, would introduce significant ambiguity in texture synthesis due to their view-dependence. Additionally, thin regions represented by single-line contours are difficult to reconstruct (e.g., slim limbs of a stick figure) due to their delicate structures. To address these issues, we propose a novel system, DrawingSpinUp, to produce plausible 3D animations and breathe life into character drawings, allowing them to freely spin up, leap, and even perform a hip-hop dance. For appearance improvement, we adopt a removal-then-restoration strategy to first remove the view-dependent contour lines and then render them back after retargeting the reconstructed character. For geometry refinement, we develop a skeleton-based thinning deformation algorithm to refine the slim structures represented by the single-line contours. The experimental evaluations and a perceptual user study show that our proposed method outperforms the existing 2D and 3D animation methods and generates high-quality 3D animations from a single character drawing. Please refer to our project page (https://lordliang.github.io/DrawingSpinUp) for the code and generated animations."
Dense Point Clouds Matter: Dust-GS for Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Viewpoints,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in scene synthesis and novel view synthesis tasks. Typically, the initialization of 3D Gaussian primitives relies on point clouds derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. However, in scenarios requiring scene reconstruction from sparse viewpoints, the effectiveness of 3DGS is significantly constrained by the quality of these initial point clouds and the limited number of input images. In this study, we present Dust-GS, a novel framework specifically designed to overcome the limitations of 3DGS in sparse viewpoint conditions. Instead of relying solely on SfM, Dust-GS introduces an innovative point cloud initialization technique that remains effective even with sparse input data. Our approach leverages a hybrid strategy that integrates an adaptive depth-based masking technique, thereby enhancing the accuracy and detail of reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Dust-GS surpasses traditional 3DGS methods in scenarios with sparse viewpoints, achieving superior scene reconstruction quality with a reduced number of input images."
DualSep: A Light-weight dual-encoder convolutional recurrent network for real-time in-car speech separation,"Advancements in deep learning and voice-activated technologies have driven the development of human-vehicle interaction. Distributed microphone arrays are widely used in in-car scenarios because they can accurately capture the voices of passengers from different speech zones. However, the increase in the number of audio channels, coupled with the limited computational resources and low latency requirements of in-car systems, presents challenges for in-car multi-channel speech separation. To migrate the problems, we propose a lightweight framework that cascades digital signal processing (DSP) and neural networks (NN). We utilize fixed beamforming (BF) to reduce computational costs and independent vector analysis (IVA) to provide spatial prior. We employ dual encoders for dual-branch modeling, with spatial encoder capturing spatial cues and spectral encoder preserving spectral information, facilitating spatial-spectral fusion. Our proposed system supports both streaming and non-streaming modes. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system across various metrics. With only 0.83M parameters and 0.39 real-time factor (RTF) on an Intel Core i7 (2.6GHz) CPU, it effectively separates speech into distinct speech zones. Our demos are available at https://honee-w.github.io/DualSep/."
Optimizing Item-based Marketing Promotion Efficiency in C2C Marketplace with Dynamic Sequential Coupon Allocation Framework,"In e-commerce platforms, coupons play a crucial role in boosting transactions. In the customer-to-customer (C2C) marketplace, ensuring the satisfaction of both buyers and sellers is essential. While buyer-focused marketing strategies often receive more attention, addressing the needs of sellers is equally important. Additionally, the existing strategies tend to optimize each promotion independently, resulting in a lack of continuity between promotions and unnecessary costs in the pursuit of short-term impact within each promotion period.   We introduce a Dynamic Sequential Coupon Allocation Framework (DSCAF) to optimize item coupon allocation strategies across a series of promotions. DSCAF provides sequential recommendations for coupon configurations and timing to target items. In cases where initial suggestions do not lead to sales, it dynamically adjusts the strategy and offers subsequent solutions. It integrates two predictors for estimating the sale propensity in the current and subsequent rounds of coupon allocation, and a decision-making process to determine the coupon allocation solution. It runs iteratively until the item is sold. The goal of the framework is to maximize Return on Investment (ROI) while ensuring lift Sell-through Rate (STR) remains above a specified threshold. DSCAF aims to optimize sequential coupon efficiency with a long-term perspective rather than solely focusing on the lift achieved in each individual promotion. It has been applied for item coupon allocation in Mercari."
Winning Strategy Templates for Stochastic Parity Games towards Permissive and Resilient Control,"Stochastic games play an important role for many purposes such as the control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where the controller and the environment are modeled as players. Conventional algorithms typically solve the game for a single winning strategy in order to develop a controller. However, in applications such as CPS control, permissive controllers are crucial as they allow the controlled system to adapt if additional constraints need to be imposed and also remain resilient to system changes at runtime. In this work, we generalize the concept of permissive winning strategy templates, introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to encompass stochastic games. These templates represent an infinite number of winning strategies and can adapt strategies to system changes efficiently. We focus on five key winning objectives -- safety, reachability, B\""uchi, co-B\""uchi, and parity -- and present algorithms to construct templates for each objective. In addition, we propose a novel method to extract a winning strategy from a template and provide discussions on template comparison."
Effective Integration of KAN for Keyword Spotting,"Keyword spotting (KWS) is an important speech processing component for smart devices with voice assistance capability. In this paper, we investigate if Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) can be used to enhance the performance of KWS. We explore various approaches to integrate KAN for a model architecture based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that KAN is effective at modeling high-level features in lower-dimensional spaces, resulting in improved KWS performance when integrated appropriately. The findings shed light on understanding KAN for speech processing tasks and on other modalities for future researchers."
Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Denoising and Deblending of Marine Seismic Data,"Processing marine seismic data is computationally demanding and consists of multiple time-consuming steps. Neural network based processing can, in theory, significantly reduce processing time and has the potential to change the way seismic processing is done. In this paper we are using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to remove seismic interference noise and to deblend seismic data. To train such networks, a significant amount of computational memory is needed since a single shot gather consists of more than 106 data samples. Preliminary results are promising both for denoising and deblending. However, we also observed that the results are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SnR). Moving to common channel domain is a way of breaking the coherency of the noise while also reducing the input volume size. This makes it easier for the network to distinguish between signal and noise. It also increases the efficiency of the GPU memory usage by enabling better utilization of multi core processing. Deblending in common channel domain with the use of a CNN yields relatively good results and is an improvement compared to shot domain."
Deep learning-based shot-domain seismic deblending,"To streamline fast-track processing of large data volumes, we have developed a deep learning approach to deblend seismic data in the shot domain based on a practical strategy for generating high-quality training data along with a list of data conditioning techniques to improve performance of the data-driven model. We make use of unblended shot gathers acquired at the end of each sail line, to which the access requires no additional time or labor costs beyond the blended acquisition. By manually blending these data we obtain training data with good control of the ground truth and fully adapted to the given survey. Furthermore, we train a deep neural network using multi-channel inputs that include adjacent blended shot gathers as additional channels. The prediction of the blending noise is added in as a related and auxiliary task with the main task of the network being the prediction of the primary-source events. Blending noise in the ground truth is scaled down during the training and validation process due to its excessively strong amplitudes. As part of the process, the to-be-deblended shot gathers are aligned by the blending noise. Implementation on field blended-by-acquisition data demonstrates that introducing the suggested data conditioning steps can considerably reduce the leakage of primary-source events in the deep part of the blended section. The complete proposed approach performs almost as well as a conventional algorithm in the shallow section and shows great advantage in efficiency. It performs slightly worse for larger traveltimes, but still removes the blending noise efficiently."
STA-V2A: Video-to-Audio Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment,"Visual and auditory perception are two crucial ways humans experience the world. Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment. The ablation experiment validated the effectiveness of each module. Audio samples are available at https://y-ren16.github.io/STAV2A."
Estimation of Graph Features Based on Random Walks Using Neighbors' Properties,"Using random walks for sampling has proven advantageous in assessing the characteristics of large and unknown social networks. Several algorithms based on random walks have been introduced in recent years. In the practical application of social network sampling, there is a recurrent reliance on an application programming interface (API) for obtaining adjacent nodes. However, owing to constraints related to query frequency and associated API expenses, it is preferable to minimize API calls during the feature estimation process. In this study, considering the acquisition of neighboring nodes as a cost factor, we introduce a feature estimation algorithm that outperforms existing algorithms in terms of accuracy. Through experiments that simulate sampling on known graphs, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of our proposed algorithm when compared to existing alternatives."
Knowledge-Enhanced Facial Expression Recognition with Emotional-to-Neutral Transformation,"Existing facial expression recognition (FER) methods typically fine-tune a pre-trained visual encoder using discrete labels. However, this form of supervision limits to specify the emotional concept of different facial expressions. In this paper, we observe that the rich knowledge in text embeddings, generated by vision-language models, is a promising alternative for learning discriminative facial expression representations. Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced FER method with an emotional-to-neutral transformation. Specifically, we formulate the FER problem as a process to match the similarity between a facial expression representation and text embeddings. Then, we transform the facial expression representation to a neutral representation by simulating the difference in text embeddings from textual facial expression to textual neutral. Finally, a self-contrast objective is introduced to pull the facial expression representation closer to the textual facial expression, while pushing it farther from the neutral representation. We conduct evaluation with diverse pre-trained visual encoders including ResNet-18 and Swin-T on four challenging facial expression datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FER methods. The code will be publicly available."
LA-RAG:Enhancing LLM-based ASR Accuracy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Recent advancements in integrating speech information into large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. However, existing methods often constrained by the capabilities of the speech encoders under varied acoustic conditions, such as accents. To address this, we propose LA-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm for LLM-based ASR. LA-RAG leverages fine-grained token-level speech datastores and a speech-to-speech retrieval mechanism to enhance ASR accuracy via LLM in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Experiments on Mandarin and various Chinese dialect datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ASR accuracy compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach, especially in handling accent variations."
Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios with Versatile Instructions,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings."
Automatic Generation of Fast and Accurate Performance Models for Deep Neural Network Accelerators,"Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a challenging task that requires tailored hardware accelerator architectures and a clear understanding of their performance characteristics when executing the intended AI workload. To facilitate this, we present an automated generation approach for fast performance models to accurately estimate the latency of a DNN mapped onto systematically modeled and concisely described accelerator architectures. Using our accelerator architecture description method, we modeled representative DNN accelerators such as Gemmini, UltraTrail, Plasticine-derived, and a parameterizable systolic array. Together with DNN mappings for those modeled architectures, we perform a combined DNN/hardware dependency graph analysis, which enables us, in the best case, to evaluate only 154 loop kernel iterations to estimate the performance for 4.19 billion instructions achieving a significant speedup. We outperform regression and analytical models in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to simulation results, while being several magnitudes faster than an RTL simulation."
Domain-Invariant Representation Learning of Bird Sounds,"Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is crucial for bioacoustic research, enabling non-invasive species tracking and biodiversity monitoring. Citizen science platforms like Xeno-Canto provide large annotated datasets from focal recordings, where the target species is intentionally recorded. However, PAM requires monitoring in passive soundscapes, creating a domain shift between focal and passive recordings, which challenges deep learning models trained on focal recordings. To address this, we leverage supervised contrastive learning to improve domain generalization in bird sound classification, enforcing domain invariance across same-class examples from different domains. We also propose ProtoCLR (Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Representations), which reduces the computational complexity of the SupCon loss by comparing examples to class prototypes instead of pairwise comparisons. Additionally, we present a new few-shot classification benchmark based on BirdSet, a large-scale bird sound dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong transfer performance."
Improved Unet model for brain tumor image segmentation based on ASPP-coordinate attention mechanism,"In this paper, we propose an improved Unet model for brain tumor image segmentation, which combines coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to improve the segmentation effect. After the data set is divided, we do the necessary preprocessing to the image and use the improved model to experiment. First, we trained and validated the traditional Unet model. By analyzing the loss curve of the training set and the validation set, we can see that the loss value continues to decline at the first epoch and becomes stable at the eighth epoch. This process shows that the model constantly optimizes its parameters to improve performance. At the same time, the change in the miou (mean Intersection over Union) index shows that the miou value exceeded 0.6 at the 15th epoch, remained above 0.6 thereafter, and reached above 0.7 at the 46th epoch. These results indicate that the basic Unet model is effective in brain tumor image segmentation. Next, we introduce an improved Unet algorithm based on coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module for experiments. By observing the loss change curves of the training set and the verification set, it is found that the loss value reaches the lowest point at the sixth epoch and then remains relatively stable. At the same time, the miou indicator has stabilized above 0.7 since the 20th epoch and has reached a maximum of 0.76. These results show that the new mechanism introduced significantly improves the segmentation ability of the model. Finally, we apply the trained traditional Unet model and the improved Unet model based on the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to the test set for brain tumor image segmentation prediction. Compared to the traditional Unet, the enhanced model offers superior segmentation and edge accuracy, providing a more reliable method for medical image analysis with the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module."
Frequency Tracking Features for Data-Efficient Deep Siren Identification,"The identification of siren sounds in urban soundscapes is a crucial safety aspect for smart vehicles and has been widely addressed by means of neural networks that ensure robustness to both the diversity of siren signals and the strong and unstructured background noise characterizing traffic. Convolutional neural networks analyzing spectrogram features of incoming signals achieve state-of-the-art performance when enough training data capturing the diversity of the target acoustic scenes is available. In practice, data is usually limited and algorithms should be robust to adapt to unseen acoustic conditions without requiring extensive datasets for re-training. In this work, given the harmonic nature of siren signals, characterized by a periodically evolving fundamental frequency, we propose a low-complexity feature extraction method based on frequency tracking using a single-parameter adaptive notch filter. The features are then used to design a small-scale convolutional network suitable for training with limited data. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the traditional spectrogram-based model when limited training data is available, achieves better cross-domain generalization and has a smaller size."
Optimizing 4D Lookup Table for Low-light Video Enhancement via Wavelet Priori,"Low-light video enhancement is highly demanding in maintaining spatiotemporal color consistency. Therefore, improving the accuracy of color mapping and keeping the latency low is challenging. Based on this, we propose incorporating Wavelet-priori for 4D Lookup Table (WaveLUT), which effectively enhances the color coherence between video frames and the accuracy of color mapping while maintaining low latency. Specifically, we use the wavelet low-frequency domain to construct an optimized lookup prior and achieve an adaptive enhancement effect through a designed Wavelet-prior 4D lookup table. To effectively compensate the a priori loss in the low light region, we further explore a dynamic fusion strategy that adaptively determines the spatial weights based on the correlation between the wavelet lighting prior and the target intensity structure. In addition, during the training phase, we devise a text-driven appearance reconstruction method that dynamically balances brightness and content through multimodal semantics-driven Fourier spectra. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets show that this method effectively enhances the previous method's ability to perceive the color space and achieves metric-favorable and perceptually oriented real-time enhancement while maintaining high efficiency."
CompressedMediQ: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Dimentional Neuroimaging Data,"This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as 4D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing."
LHQ-SVC: Lightweight and High Quality Singing Voice Conversion Modeling,"Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) has emerged as a significant subfield of Voice Conversion (VC), enabling the transformation of one singer's voice into another while preserving musical elements such as melody, rhythm, and timbre. Traditional SVC methods have limitations in terms of audio quality, data requirements, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose LHQ-SVC, a lightweight, CPU-compatible model based on the SVC framework and diffusion model, designed to reduce model size and computational demand without sacrificing performance. We incorporate features to improve inference quality, and optimize for CPU execution by using performance tuning tools and parallel computing frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate that LHQ-SVC maintains competitive performance, with significant improvements in processing speed and efficiency across different devices. The results suggest that LHQ-SVC can meet"
ChangeChat: An Interactive Model for Remote Sensing Change Analysis via Multimodal Instruction Tuning,"Remote sensing (RS) change analysis is vital for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes by detecting alterations in images over time. Traditional change detection excels at identifying pixel-level changes but lacks the ability to contextualize these alterations. While recent advancements in change captioning offer natural language descriptions of changes, they do not support interactive, user-specific queries. To address these limitations, we introduce ChangeChat, the first bitemporal vision-language model (VLM) designed specifically for RS change analysis. ChangeChat utilizes multimodal instruction tuning, allowing it to handle complex queries such as change captioning, category-specific quantification, and change localization. To enhance the model's performance, we developed the ChangeChat-87k dataset, which was generated using a combination of rule-based methods and GPT-assisted techniques. Experiments show that ChangeChat offers a comprehensive, interactive solution for RS change analysis, achieving performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on specific tasks, and significantly surpassing the latest general-domain model, GPT-4. Code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/ChangeChat."
Learning Short Codes for Fading Channels with No or Receiver-Only Channel State Information,"In next-generation wireless networks, low latency often necessitates short-length codewords that either do not use channel state information (CSI) or rely solely on CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Gaussian codes that achieve capacity for AWGN channels may be unsuitable for these no-CSI and CSIR-only cases. In this work, we design short-length codewords for these cases using an autoencoder architecture. From the designed codes, we observe the following: In the no-CSI case, the learned codes are mutually orthogonal when the distribution of the real and imaginary parts of the fading random variable has support over the entire real line. However, when the support is limited to the non-negative real line, the codes are not mutually orthogonal. For the CSIR-only case, deep learning-based codes designed for AWGN channels perform worse in fading channels with optimal coherent detection compared to codes specifically designed for fading channels with CSIR, where the autoencoder jointly learns encoding, coherent combining, and decoding. In both no-CSI and CSIR-only cases, the codes perform at least as well as or better than classical codes of the same block length."
Molecular Graph Representation Learning via Structural Similarity Information,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed for feature representation learning in molecular graphs. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the expressiveness of feature representation to ensure the effectiveness of GNNs. However, a significant portion of current research primarily focuses on the structural features within individual molecules, often overlooking the structural similarity between molecules, which is a crucial aspect encapsulating rich information on the relationship between molecular properties and structural characteristics. Thus, these approaches fail to capture the rich semantic information at the molecular structure level. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Molecular Structural Similarity Motif GNN (MSSM-GNN)}, a novel molecular graph representation learning method that can capture structural similarity information among molecules from a global perspective. In particular, we propose a specially designed graph that leverages graph kernel algorithms to represent the similarity between molecules quantitatively. Subsequently, we employ GNNs to learn feature representations from molecular graphs, aiming to enhance the accuracy of property prediction by incorporating additional molecular representation information. Finally, through a series of experiments conducted on both small-scale and large-scale molecular datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines. The codes are available at https://github.com/yaoyao-yaoyao-cell/MSSM-GNN."
Secure Offloading in NOMA-Aided Aerial MEC Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can reduce user latency and energy consumption by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the edge servers. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology enable the MEC networks to provide offloaded computing services for massively accessed terrestrial users conveniently. However, the broadcast nature of signal propagation in NOMA-based UAV-MEC networks makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping by malicious eavesdroppers. In this work, a secure offload scheme is proposed for NOMA-based UAV-MEC systems with the existence of an aerial eavesdropper. The long-term average network computational cost is minimized by jointly designing the UAV's trajectory, the terrestrial users' transmit power, and computational frequency while ensuring the security of users' offloaded data. Due to the eavesdropper's location uncertainty, the worst-case security scenario is considered through the estimated eavesdropping range. Due to the high-dimensional continuous action space, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is utilized to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."
Dynamics of Collective Group Affect: Group-level Annotations and the Multimodal Modeling of Convergence and Divergence,"Collaborating in a group, whether face-to-face or virtually, involves continuously expressing emotions and interpreting those of other group members. Therefore, understanding group affect is essential to comprehending how groups interact and succeed in collaborative efforts. In this study, we move beyond individual-level affect and investigate group-level affect -- a collective phenomenon that reflects the shared mood or emotions among group members at a particular moment. As the first in literature, we gather annotations for group-level affective expressions using a fine-grained temporal approach (15 second windows) that also captures the inherent dynamics of the collective construct. To this end, we use trained annotators and an annotation procedure specifically tuned to capture the entire scope of the group interaction. In addition, we model group affect dynamics over time. One way to study the ebb and flow of group affect in group interactions is to model the underlying convergence (driven by emotional contagion) and divergence (resulting from emotional reactivity) of affective expressions amongst group members. To capture these interpersonal dynamics, we extract synchrony based features from both audio and visual social signal cues. An analysis of these features reveals that interacting groups tend to diverge in terms of their social signals along neutral levels of group affect, and converge along extreme levels of affect expression. We further present results on the predictive modeling of dynamic group affect which underscores the importance of using synchrony-based features in the modeling process, as well as the multimodal nature of group affect. We anticipate that the presented models will serve as the baselines of future research on the automatic recognition of dynamic group affect."
Exploring Remote Collaboration: The Impact of Avatar Representation on Dyadic Haptic Interactions in Shared Virtual Environments,"This study is the first to explore the interplay between haptic interaction and avatar representation in Shared Virtual Environments (SVEs). We focus on their combined effect on social presence and task-related scores in dyadic collaborations. In a series of experiments, participants performed the plate control task with haptic interaction under four avatar representation conditions: avatars of both participant and partner were displayed, only the participant's avatar was displayed, only the partner's avatar was displayed, and no avatars were displayed. The study finds that avatar representation, especially of the partner, significantly enhances the perception of social presence, which haptic interaction alone does not fully achieve. In contrast, neither the presence nor the type of avatar representation impacts the task performance or participants' force effort of the task, suggesting that haptic interaction provides sufficient interaction cues for the execution of the task. These results underscore the significance of integrating both visual and haptic modalities to optimize remote collaboration experiences in virtual environments, ensuring effective communication and a strong sense of social presence."
Generalization of Gershgorin's theorem. Analysis and design of control laws,"The application of the Gershgorin circle theorem and some of its derivatives to estimate the eigenvalues of a matrix is considered. The obtained results are developed to obtain the localization region of the eigenvalues of a matrix with interval-indefinite constant or non-stationary elements. The concept of e-circles is introduced to obtain more accurate estimates of these regions than when using Gershgorin circles. The obtained results are applied to the stability analysis of network systems, where it is shown that the proposed methods allow one to analyze a network with a much larger number of agents than when using the CVX, Yalmip, eig and lyap methods (functions in MatLab). It is further shown that if the obtained results are applied not to the system itself, but to the result obtained using the Lyapunov function method, then one can study systems with matrices without diagonal dominance. This made it possible to consider a modification of the Demidovich condition for systems with non-stationary parameters and design of a control law for non-stationary systems with matrices without diagonal dominance. All obtained results are illustrated by numerical modeling."
HTR-VT: Handwritten Text Recognition with Vision Transformer,"We explore the application of Vision Transformer (ViT) for handwritten text recognition. The limited availability of labeled data in this domain poses challenges for achieving high performance solely relying on ViT. Previous transformer-based models required external data or extensive pre-training on large datasets to excel. To address this limitation, we introduce a data-efficient ViT method that uses only the encoder of the standard transformer. We find that incorporating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction instead of the original patch embedding and employ Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to ensure that the model can converge towards flatter minima and yield notable enhancements. Furthermore, our introduction of the span mask technique, which masks interconnected features in the feature map, acts as an effective regularizer. Empirically, our approach competes favorably with traditional CNN-based models on small datasets like IAM and READ2016. Additionally, it establishes a new benchmark on the LAM dataset, currently the largest dataset with 19,830 training text lines. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/YutingLi0606/HTR-VT."
DiffFAS: Face Anti-Spoofing via Generative Diffusion Models,"Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in preventing face recognition (FR) systems from presentation attacks. Nowadays, FAS systems face the challenge of domain shift, impacting the generalization performance of existing FAS methods. In this paper, we rethink about the inherence of domain shift and deconstruct it into two factors: image style and image quality. Quality influences the purity of the presentation of spoof information, while style affects the manner in which spoof information is presented. Based on our analysis, we propose DiffFAS framework, which quantifies quality as prior information input into the network to counter image quality shift, and performs diffusion-based high-fidelity cross-domain and cross-attack types generation to counter image style shift. DiffFAS transforms easily collectible live faces into high-fidelity attack faces with precise labels while maintaining consistency between live and spoof face identities, which can also alleviate the scarcity of labeled data with novel type attacks faced by nowadays FAS system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on challenging cross-domain and cross-attack FAS datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Available at https://github.com/murphytju/DiffFAS."
Batch Ensemble for Variance Dependent Regret in Stochastic Bandits,"Efficiently trading off exploration and exploitation is one of the key challenges in online Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most works achieve this by carefully estimating the model uncertainty and following the so-called optimistic model. Inspired by practical ensemble methods, in this work we propose a simple and novel batch ensemble scheme that provably achieves near-optimal regret for stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). Crucially, our algorithm has just a single parameter, namely the number of batches, and its value does not depend on distributional properties such as the scale and variance of the losses. We complement our theoretical results by demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic benchmarks."
Hybrid-TTA: Continual Test-time Adaptation via Dynamic Domain Shift Detection,"Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) has emerged as a critical approach for bridging the domain gap between the controlled training environments and the real-world scenarios, enhancing model adaptability and robustness. Existing CTTA methods, typically categorized into Full-Tuning (FT) and Efficient-Tuning (ET), struggle with effectively addressing domain shifts. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-TTA, a holistic approach that dynamically selects instance-wise tuning method for optimal adaptation. Our approach introduces the Dynamic Domain Shift Detection (DDSD) strategy, which identifies domain shifts by leveraging temporal correlations in input sequences and dynamically switches between FT and ET to adapt to varying domain shifts effectively. Additionally, the Masked Image Modeling based Adaptation (MIMA) framework is integrated to ensure domain-agnostic robustness with minimal computational overhead. Our Hybrid-TTA achieves a notable 1.6%p improvement in mIoU on the Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods and offering a robust solution for real-world continual adaptation challenges."
Cracking the Code: Multi-domain LLM Evaluation on Real-World Professional Exams in Indonesia,"While knowledge evaluation in large language models has predominantly focused on academic subjects like math and physics, these assessments often fail to capture the practical demands of real-world professions. In this paper, we introduce IndoCareer, a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law. Our comprehensive evaluation of 27 large language models shows that these models struggle particularly in fields with strong local contexts, such as insurance and finance. Additionally, while using the entire dataset, shuffling answer options generally maintains consistent evaluation results across models, but it introduces instability specifically in the insurance and finance sectors."
Second-order difference subspace,"Subspace representation is a fundamental technique in various fields of machine learning. Analyzing a geometrical relationship among multiple subspaces is essential for understanding subspace series' temporal and/or spatial dynamics. This paper proposes the second-order difference subspace, a higher-order extension of the first-order difference subspace between two subspaces that can analyze the geometrical difference between them. As a preliminary for that, we extend the definition of the first-order difference subspace to the more general setting that two subspaces with different dimensions have an intersection. We then define the second-order difference subspace by combining the concept of first-order difference subspace and principal component subspace (Karcher mean) between two subspaces, motivated by the second-order central difference method. We can understand that the first/second-order difference subspaces correspond to the velocity and acceleration of subspace dynamics from the viewpoint of a geodesic on a Grassmann manifold. We demonstrate the validity and naturalness of our second-order difference subspace by showing numerical results on two applications: temporal shape analysis of a 3D object and time series analysis of a biometric signal."
CSS: Overcoming Pose and Scene Challenges in Crowd-Sourced 3D Gaussian Splatting,"We introduce Crowd-Sourced Splatting (CSS), a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipeline designed to overcome the challenges of pose-free scene reconstruction using crowd-sourced imagery. The dream of reconstructing historically significant but inaccessible scenes from collections of photographs has long captivated researchers. However, traditional 3D techniques struggle with missing camera poses, limited viewpoints, and inconsistent lighting. CSS addresses these challenges through robust geometric priors and advanced illumination modeling, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis under complex, real-world conditions. Our method demonstrates clear improvements over existing approaches, paving the way for more accurate and flexible applications in AR, VR, and large-scale 3D reconstruction."
Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden Chain-of-Thought Decoding,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning and multi-step problem-solving through the use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, generating the full CoT process results in significantly longer output sequences, leading to increased computational costs and latency during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compress the CoT process through semantic alignment, enabling more efficient decoding while preserving the benefits of CoT reasoning. Our method introduces an auxiliary CoT model that learns to generate and compress the full thought process into a compact special token representation semantically aligned with the original CoT output. This compressed representation is then integrated into the input of the Hidden Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) model. The training process follows a two-stage procedure: First, the CoT model is optimized to generate the compressed token representations aligned with the ground-truth CoT outputs using a contrastive loss. Subsequently, with the CoT model parameters frozen, the HCoT model is fine-tuned to generate accurate subsequent predictions conditioned on the prefix instruction and the compressed CoT representations from the CoT model. Extensive experiments across three challenging domains - mathematical reasoning, agent invocation, and question answering - demonstrate that our semantic compression approach achieves competitive or improved performance compared to the full CoT baseline, while providing significant speedups of at least 1.5x in decoding time. Moreover, incorporating contrastive learning objectives further enhances the quality of the compressed representations, leading to better CoT prompting and improved task accuracy. Our work paves the way for more efficient exploitation of multi-step reasoning capabilities in LLMs across a wide range of applications."
Fair CoVariance Neural Networks,"Covariance-based data processing is widespread across signal processing and machine learning applications due to its ability to model data interconnectivities and dependencies. However, harmful biases in the data may become encoded in the sample covariance matrix and cause data-driven methods to treat different subpopulations unfairly. Existing works such as fair principal component analysis (PCA) mitigate these effects, but remain unstable in low sample regimes, which in turn may jeopardize the fairness goal. To address both biases and instability, we propose Fair coVariance Neural Networks (FVNNs), which perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix for both fair and accurate predictions. Our FVNNs provide a flexible model compatible with several existing bias mitigation techniques. In particular, FVNNs allow for mitigating the bias in two ways: first, they operate on fair covariance estimates that remove biases from their principal components; second, they are trained in an end-to-end fashion via a fairness regularizer in the loss function so that the model parameters are tailored to solve the task directly in a fair manner. We prove that FVNNs are intrinsically fairer than analogous PCA approaches thanks to their stability in low sample regimes. We validate the robustness and fairness of our model on synthetic and real-world data, showcasing the flexibility of FVNNs along with the tradeoff between fair and accurate performance."
DICS: Find Domain-Invariant and Class-Specific Features for Out-of-Distribution Generalization,"While deep neural networks have made remarkable progress in various vision tasks, their performance typically deteriorates when tested in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Many OOD methods focus on extracting domain-invariant features but neglect whether these features are unique to each class. Even if some features are domain-invariant, they cannot serve as key classification criteria if shared across different classes. In OOD tasks, both domain-related and class-shared features act as confounders that hinder generalization. In this paper, we propose a DICS model to extract Domain-Invariant and Class-Specific features, including Domain Invariance Testing (DIT) and Class Specificity Testing (CST), which mitigate the effects of spurious correlations introduced by confounders. DIT learns domain-related features of each source domain and removes them from inputs to isolate domain-invariant class-related features. DIT ensures domain invariance by aligning same-class features across different domains. Then, CST calculates soft labels for those features by comparing them with features learned in previous steps. We optimize the cross-entropy between the soft labels and their true labels, which enhances same-class similarity and different-class distinctiveness, thereby reinforcing class specificity. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Additional visualizations further demonstrate that DICS effectively identifies the key features of each class in target domains."
An Empirical Analysis of Git Commit Logs for Potential Inconsistency in Code Clones,"Code clones are code snippets that are identical or similar to other snippets within the same or different files. They are often created through copy-and-paste practices and modified during development and maintenance activities. Since a pair of code clones, known as a clone pair, has a possible logical coupling between them, it is expected that changes to each snippet are made simultaneously (co-changed) and consistently. There is extensive research on code clones, including studies related to the co-change of clones; however, detailed analysis of commit logs for code clone pairs has been limited.   In this paper, we investigate the commit logs of code snippets from clone pairs, using the git-log command to extract changes to cloned code snippets. We analyzed 45 repositories owned by the Apache Software Foundation on GitHub and addressed three research questions regarding commit frequency, co-change ratio, and commit patterns. Our findings indicate that (1) on average, clone snippets are changed infrequently, typically only two or three times throughout their lifetime, (2) the ratio of co-changes is about half of all clone changes, with 10-20\% of co-changed commits being concerning (potentially inconsistent), and (3) 35-65\% of all clone pairs being classified as concerning clone pairs (potentially inconsistent clone pairs). These results suggest the need for a consistent management system through the commit timeline of clones."
LLM-Powered Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Benchmark and Case Study,"Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is critical in speech processing, particularly for applications like speech synthesis. G2P systems must possess linguistic understanding and contextual awareness of languages with polyphone words and context-dependent phonemes. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in various language tasks, suggesting that their phonetic knowledge could be leveraged for G2P. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in G2P conversion and introduce prompting and post-processing methods that enhance LLM outputs without additional training or labeled data. We also present a benchmarking dataset designed to assess G2P performance on sentence-level phonetic challenges of the Persian language. Our results show that by applying the proposed methods, LLMs can outperform traditional G2P tools, even in an underrepresented language like Persian, highlighting the potential of developing LLM-aided G2P systems."
Unified Audio Event Detection,"Sound Event Detection (SED) detects regions of sound events, while Speaker Diarization (SD) segments speech conversations attributed to individual speakers. In SED, all speaker segments are classified as a single speech event, while in SD, non-speech sounds are treated merely as background noise. Thus, both tasks provide only partial analysis in complex audio scenarios involving both speech conversation and non-speech sounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Unified Audio Event Detection (UAED) for comprehensive audio analysis. UAED explores the synergy between SED and SD tasks, simultaneously detecting non-speech sound events and fine-grained speech events based on speaker identities. To tackle this task, we propose a Transformer-based UAED (T-UAED) framework and construct the UAED Data derived from the Librispeech dataset and DESED soundbank. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively exploits task interactions and substantially outperforms the baseline that simply combines the outputs of SED and SD models. T-UAED also shows its versatility by performing comparably to specialized models for individual SED and SD tasks on DESED and CALLHOME datasets."
Think Twice Before You Act: Improving Inverse Problem Solving With MCMC,"Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as a strong prior for solving inverse problems. A prominent example is Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), which approximates the posterior distribution of data given the measure using Tweedie's formula. Despite the merits of being versatile in solving various inverse problems without re-training, the performance of DPS is hindered by the fact that this posterior approximation can be inaccurate especially for high noise levels. Therefore, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}osterior \textbf{MC}MC (\textbf{DPMC}), a novel inference algorithm based on Annealed MCMC to solve inverse problems with pretrained diffusion models. We define a series of intermediate distributions inspired by the approximated conditional distributions used by DPS. Through annealed MCMC sampling, we encourage the samples to follow each intermediate distribution more closely before moving to the next distribution at a lower noise level, and therefore reduce the accumulated error along the path. We test our algorithm in various inverse problems, including super resolution, Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, inpainting, and phase retrieval. Our algorithm outperforms DPS with less number of evaluations across nearly all tasks, and is competitive among existing approaches."
OIDM: An Observability-based Intelligent Distributed Edge Sensing Method for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems,"Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) integrate physical processes with computational and communication technologies in industrial settings. With the support of edge computing technology, it is feasible to schedule large-scale sensors for efficient distributed sensing. In the sensing process, observability is the key to obtaining complete system states, and stochastic scheduling is more suitable considering uncertain factors in wireless communication. However, existing works have limited research on observability in stochastic scheduling. Targeting this issue, we propose an observability-based intelligent distributed edge sensing method (OIDM). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are adopted to optimize sensing accuracy and power efficiency. Based on the system's ability to achieve observability, we establish a bridge between observability and the number of successful sensor transmissions. Novel linear approximations of observability criteria are provided, and probabilistic bounds on observability are derived. Furthermore, these bounds guide the design of action space to achieve a probabilistic observability guarantee in stochastic scheduling. Finally, our proposed method is applied to the estimation of slab temperature in industrial hot rolling process, and simulation results validate its effectiveness."
On Robustness to $k$-wise Independence of Optimal Bayesian Mechanisms,"This paper reexamines the classic problem of revenue maximization in single-item auctions with $n$ buyers under the lens of the robust optimization framework. The celebrated Myerson's mechanism is the format that maximizes the seller's revenue under the prior distribution, which is mutually independent across all $n$ buyers. As argued in a recent line of work (Caragiannis et al. 22), (Dughmi et al. 24), mutual independence is a strong assumption that is extremely hard to verify statistically, thus it is important to relax the assumption.   While optimal under mutual independent prior, we find that Myerson's mechanism may lose almost all of its revenue when the independence assumption is relaxed to pairwise independence, i.e., Myerson's mechanism is not pairwise-robust. The mechanism regains robustness when the prior is assumed to be 3-wise independent. In contrast, we show that second-price auctions with anonymous reserve, including optimal auctions under i.i.d. priors, lose at most a constant fraction of their revenues on any regular pairwise independent prior. Our findings draw a comprehensive picture of robustness to $k$-wise independence in single-item auction settings."
Causal GNNs: A GNN-Driven Instrumental Variable Approach for Causal Inference in Networks,"As network data applications continue to expand, causal inference within networks has garnered increasing attention. However, hidden confounders complicate the estimation of causal effects. Most methods rely on the strong ignorability assumption, which presumes the absence of hidden confounders-an assumption that is both difficult to validate and often unrealistic in practice. To address this issue, we propose CgNN, a novel approach that leverages network structure as instrumental variables (IVs), combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to mitigate hidden confounder bias and improve causal effect estimation. By utilizing network structure as IVs, we reduce confounder bias while preserving the correlation with treatment. Our integration of attention mechanisms enhances robustness and improves the identification of important nodes. Validated on two real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that CgNN effectively mitigates hidden confounder bias and offers a robust GNN-driven IV framework for causal inference in complex network data."
ATFLRec: A Multimodal Recommender System with Audio-Text Fusion and Low-Rank Adaptation via Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model,"Recommender Systems (RS) play a pivotal role in boosting user satisfaction by providing personalized product suggestions in domains such as e-commerce and entertainment. This study examines the integration of multimodal data text and audio into large language models (LLMs) with the aim of enhancing recommendation performance. Traditional text and audio recommenders encounter limitations such as the cold-start problem, and recent advancements in LLMs, while promising, are computationally expensive. To address these issues, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is introduced, which enhances efficiency without compromising performance. The ATFLRec framework is proposed to integrate audio and text modalities into a multimodal recommendation system, utilizing various LoRA configurations and modality fusion techniques. Results indicate that ATFLRec outperforms baseline models, including traditional and graph neural network-based approaches, achieving higher AUC scores. Furthermore, separate fine-tuning of audio and text data with distinct LoRA modules yields optimal performance, with different pooling methods and Mel filter bank numbers significantly impacting performance. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing multimodal recommender systems and advancing the integration of diverse data modalities in LLMs."
An Efficient Privacy-aware Split Learning Framework for Satellite Communications,"In the rapidly evolving domain of satellite communications, integrating advanced machine learning techniques, particularly split learning, is crucial for enhancing data processing and model training efficiency across satellites, space stations, and ground stations. Traditional ML approaches often face significant challenges within satellite networks due to constraints such as limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for more efficient SL in satellite communications. Our approach, Dynamic Topology Informed Pruning, namely DTIP, combines differential privacy with graph and model pruning to optimize graph neural networks for distributed learning. DTIP strategically applies differential privacy to raw graph data and prunes GNNs, thereby optimizing both model size and communication load across network tiers. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate DTIP's efficacy in enhancing privacy, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Specifically, on Amazon2M dataset, DTIP maintains an accuracy of 0.82 while achieving a 50% reduction in floating-point operations per second. Similarly, on ArXiv dataset, DTIP achieves an accuracy of 0.85 under comparable conditions. Our framework not only significantly improves the operational efficiency of satellite communications but also establishes a new benchmark in privacy-aware distributed learning, potentially revolutionizing data handling in space-based networks."
SRE-CNN: A Spatiotemporal Rotation-Equivariant CNN for Cardiac Cine MR Imaging,"Dynamic MR images possess various transformation symmetries,including the rotation symmetry of local features within the image and along the temporal dimension. Utilizing these symmetries as prior knowledge can facilitate dynamic MR imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. Equivariant CNN is an effective tool to leverage the symmetry priors. However, current equivariant CNN methods fail to fully exploit these symmetry priors in dynamic MR imaging. In this work, we propose a novel framework of Spatiotemporal Rotation-Equivariant CNN (SRE-CNN), spanning from the underlying high-precision filter design to the construction of the temporal-equivariant convolutional module and imaging model, to fully harness the rotation symmetries inherent in dynamic MR images. The temporal-equivariant convolutional module enables exploitation the rotation symmetries in both spatial and temporal dimensions, while the high-precision convolutional filter, based on parametrization strategy, enhances the utilization of rotation symmetry of local features to improve the reconstruction of detailed anatomical structures. Experiments conducted on highly undersampled dynamic cardiac cine data (up to 20X) have demonstrated the superior performance of our proposed approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively."
AnalogGym: An Open and Practical Testing Suite for Analog Circuit Synthesis,"Recent advances in machine learning (ML) for automating analog circuit synthesis have been significant, yet challenges remain. A critical gap is the lack of a standardized evaluation framework, compounded by various process design kits (PDKs), simulation tools, and a limited variety of circuit topologies. These factors hinder direct comparisons and the validation of algorithms. To address these shortcomings, we introduced AnalogGym, an open-source testing suite designed to provide fair and comprehensive evaluations. AnalogGym includes 30 circuit topologies in five categories: sensing front ends, voltage references, low dropout regulators, amplifiers, and phase-locked loops. It supports several technology nodes for academic and commercial applications and is compatible with commercial simulators such as Cadence Spectre, Synopsys HSPICE, and the open-source simulator Ngspice. AnalogGym standardizes the assessment of ML algorithms in analog circuit synthesis and promotes reproducibility with its open datasets and detailed benchmark specifications. AnalogGym's user-friendly design allows researchers to easily adapt it for robust, transparent comparisons of state-of-the-art methods, while also exposing them to real-world industrial design challenges, enhancing the practical relevance of their work. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive comparison study of various analog sizing methods on AnalogGym, highlighting the capabilities and advantages of different approaches. AnalogGym is available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/CODA-Team/AnalogGym. The documentation is also available at http://coda-team.github.io/AnalogGym/."
On the B-series composition theorem,"The B-series composition theorem has been an important topic in numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations for the past-half century. Traditional proofs of this theorem rely on labelled trees, whereas recent developments in B-series analysis favour the use of unlabelled trees. In this paper, we present a new proof of the B-series composition theorem that does not depend on labelled trees. A key challenge in this approach is accurately counting combinations related to ``pruning.'' This challenge is overcome by introducing the concept of ``assignment.''"
Fractional-step High-order and Bound-preserving Method for Convection Diffusion Equations,"In this paper, we derive two bound-preserving and mass-conserving schemes based on the fractional-step method and high-order compact (HOC) finite difference method for nonlinear convection-dominated diffusion equations. We split the one-dimensional equation into three stages, and employ appropriate temporal and spatial discrete schemes respectively. We show that our scheme is weakly monotonic and that the bound-preserving property can be achieved using the bound-preserving limiter under some mild step constraints. By employing the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, we extend the scheme to two-dimensional problems, further reducing computational cost. We also provide various numerical experiments to verify our theoretical results."
Integration of Mamba and Transformer -- MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics,"Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state-space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency."
1D-CNN-IDS: 1D CNN-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT,"The demand of the Internet of Things (IoT) has witnessed exponential growth. These progresses are made possible by the technological advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge computing. However, these advancements exhibit multiple challenges, including cyber threats, security and privacy concerns, and the risk of potential financial losses. For this reason, this study developed a computationally inexpensive one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) algorithm for cyber-attack classification. The proposed study achieved an accuracy of 99.90% to classify nine cyber-attacks. Multiple other performance metrices have been evaluated to validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. In addition, comparison has been done with existing state-of-the-art schemes. The findings of the proposed study can significantly contribute to the development of secure intrusion detection for IIoT systems."
EHC-MM: Embodied Holistic Control for Mobile Manipulation,"Mobile manipulation typically entails the base for mobility, the arm for accurate manipulation, and the camera for perception. It is necessary to follow the principle of Distant Mobility, Close Grasping(DMCG) in holistic control. We propose Embodied Holistic Control for Mobile Manipulation(EHC-MM) with the embodied function of sig(w): By formulating the DMCG principle as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, sig(w) dynamically balances the robot's emphasis between movement and manipulation with the consideration of the robot's state and environment. In addition, we propose the Monitor-Position-Based Servoing (MPBS) with sig(w), enabling the tracking of the target during the operation. This approach allows coordinated control between the robot's base, arm, and camera. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, our approach significantly improves both the success rate and efficiency of mobile manipulation tasks, achieving a 95.6% success rate in the real-world scenarios and a 52.8% increase in time efficiency."
Deep Picard Iteration for High-Dimensional Nonlinear PDEs,"We present the Deep Picard Iteration (DPI) method, a new deep learning approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). The core innovation of DPI lies in its use of Picard iteration to reformulate the typically complex training objectives of neural network-based PDE solutions into much simpler, standard regression tasks based on function values and gradients. This design not only greatly simplifies the optimization process but also offers the potential for further scalability through parallel data generation. Crucially, to fully realize the benefits of regressing on both function values and gradients in the DPI method, we address the issue of infinite variance in the estimators of gradients by incorporating a control variate, supported by our theoretical analysis. Our experiments on problems up to 100 dimensions demonstrate that DPI consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with greater robustness to hyperparameters, particularly in challenging scenarios with long time horizons and strong nonlinearity."
Frequency Diverse RIS (FD-RIS) Enhanced Wireless Communications via Joint Distance-Angle Beamforming,"The conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted far-field communication systems can only implement angle beamforming, which actually limits the capability for reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a newly designed frequency diverse RIS (FD-RIS), which can achieve joint distance-angle beamforming with the assistance of the time modulation technology. The signal processing model for FD-RIS-aided wireless communications is first derived. Then, an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the achievable rate is formulated where the frequency-time modulations are jointly optimized to achieve distance-angle beamforming. Furthermore, a novel iterative algorithm based on the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) framework is proposed to effectively handle the non-convex optimization problem. The numerical results validate that the proposed FD-RIS assisted communication scheme can achieve a notable performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme utilizing traditional RIS. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed CEO algorithm is further verified by comparing with the benchmark using the genetic algorithm (GA)."
Eir: Thai Medical Large Language Models,"We present Eir Thai Medical LLM, a large language model with 8 billion parameters, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of handling medical tasks in the Thai language. This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers.   To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds. The internal API connection is secured with encryption and strict authentication measures to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.   We evaluated several open-source large language models with 8 billion parameters on four medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and the medical subset of MMLU. The best-performing baselines were used to develop Eir Thai Medical LLM. Our evaluation employed multiple questioning strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble/self-consistency voting methods. Our model outperformed commercially available Thai-language large language models by more than 10%. In addition, we developed enhanced model testing tailored for clinical use in Thai across 18 clinical tasks, where our model exceeded GPT-4o performance by more than 11%"
MAPX: An explainable model-agnostic framework for the detection of false information on social media networks,"The automated detection of false information has become a fundamental task in combating the spread of ""fake news"" on online social media networks (OSMN) as it reduces the need for manual discernment by individuals. In the literature, leveraging various content or context features of OSMN documents have been found useful. However, most of the existing detection models often utilise these features in isolation without regard to the temporal and dynamic changes oft-seen in reality, thus, limiting the robustness of the models. Furthermore, there has been little to no consideration of the impact of the quality of documents' features on the trustworthiness of the final prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework, called MAPX, which allows evidence based aggregation of predictions from existing models in an explainable manner. Indeed, the developed aggregation method is adaptive, dynamic and considers the quality of OSMN document features. Further, we perform extensive experiments on benchmarked fake news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPX using various real-world data quality scenarios. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models evaluated. For reproducibility, a demo of MAPX is available at \href{https://github.com/SCondran/MAPX_framework}{this link}"
Optimal Classification-based Anomaly Detection with Neural Networks: Theory and Practice,"Anomaly detection is an important problem in many application areas, such as network security. Many deep learning methods for unsupervised anomaly detection produce good empirical performance but lack theoretical guarantees. By casting anomaly detection into a binary classification problem, we establish non-asymptotic upper bounds and a convergence rate on the excess risk on rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks trained on synthetic anomalies. Our convergence rate on the excess risk matches the minimax optimal rate in the literature. Furthermore, we provide lower and upper bounds on the number of synthetic anomalies that can attain this optimality. For practical implementation, we relax some conditions to improve the search for the empirical risk minimizer, which leads to competitive performance to other classification-based methods for anomaly detection. Overall, our work provides the first theoretical guarantees of unsupervised neural network-based anomaly detectors and empirical insights on how to design them well."
GroundingBooth: Grounding Text-to-Image Customization,"Recent studies in text-to-image customization show great success in generating personalized object variants given several images of a subject. While existing methods focus more on preserving the identity of the subject, they often fall short of controlling the spatial relationship between objects. In this work, we introduce GroundingBooth, a framework that achieves zero-shot instance-level spatial grounding on both foreground subjects and background objects in the text-to-image customization task. Our proposed text-image grounding module and masked cross-attention layer allow us to generate personalized images with both accurate layout alignment and identity preservation while maintaining text-image coherence. With such layout control, our model inherently enables the customization of multiple subjects at once. Our model is evaluated on both layout-guided image synthesis and reference-based customization tasks, showing strong results compared to existing methods. Our work is the first work to achieve a joint grounding of both subject-driven foreground generation and text-driven background generation."
Fast Comparative Analysis of Merge Trees Using Locality Sensitive Hashing,"Scalar field comparison is a fundamental task in scientific visualization. In topological data analysis, we compare topological descriptors of scalar fields -- such as persistence diagrams and merge trees -- because they provide succinct and robust abstract representations. Several similarity measures for topological descriptors seem to be both asymptotically and practically efficient with polynomial time algorithms, but they do not scale well when handling large-scale, time-varying scientific data and ensembles. In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our LSH framework in applications such as shape matching, clustering, key event detection, and ensemble summarization."
Anytime Continual Learning for Open Vocabulary Classification,"We propose an approach for anytime continual learning (AnytimeCL) for open vocabulary image classification. The AnytimeCL problem aims to break away from batch training and rigid models by requiring that a system can predict any set of labels at any time and efficiently update and improve when receiving one or more training samples at any time. Despite the challenging goal, we achieve substantial improvements over recent methods. We propose a dynamic weighting between predictions of a partially fine-tuned model and a fixed open vocabulary model that enables continual improvement when training samples are available for a subset of a task's labels. We also propose an attention-weighted PCA compression of training features that reduces storage and computation with little impact to model accuracy. Our methods are validated with experiments that test flexibility of learning and inference. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/AnytimeCL."
AWF: Adaptive Weight Fusion for Enhanced Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a balance between previously learned and newly introduced knowledge. Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF. And our experiment code will be released on Github."
Apollo: Band-sequence Modeling for High-Quality Audio Restoration,"Audio restoration has become increasingly significant in modern society, not only due to the demand for high-quality auditory experiences enabled by advanced playback devices, but also because the growing capabilities of generative audio models necessitate high-fidelity audio. Typically, audio restoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damaged input, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception and distortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- and high-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies in designing a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information while accurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content. Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech enhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model designed for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit frequency band split module to model the relationships between different frequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio. Evaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistently outperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres, particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multiple instruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code for Apollo is publicly available at https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo."
Mamba-YOLO-World: Marrying YOLO-World with Mamba for Open-Vocabulary Detection,"Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond a predefined set of categories. As a pioneering model incorporating the YOLO series into OVD, YOLO-World is well-suited for scenarios prioritizing speed and efficiency.However, its performance is hindered by its neck feature fusion mechanism, which causes the quadratic complexity and the limited guided receptive fields.To address these limitations, we present Mamba-YOLO-World, a novel YOLO-based OVD model employing the proposed MambaFusion Path Aggregation Network (MambaFusion-PAN) as its neck architecture. Specifically, we introduce an innovative State Space Model-based feature fusion mechanism consisting of a Parallel-Guided Selective Scan algorithm and a Serial-Guided Selective Scan algorithm with linear complexity and globally guided receptive fields. It leverages multi-modal input sequences and mamba hidden states to guide the selective scanning process.Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the original YOLO-World on the COCO and LVIS benchmarks in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings while maintaining comparable parameters and FLOPs. Additionally, it surpasses existing state-of-the-art OVD methods with fewer parameters and FLOPs."
Learning Graph-based Patch Representations for Identifying and Assessing Silent Vulnerability Fixes,"Software projects are dependent on many third-party libraries, therefore high-risk vulnerabilities can propagate through the dependency chain to downstream projects. Owing to the subjective nature of patch management, software vendors commonly fix vulnerabilities silently. Silent vulnerability fixes cause downstream software to be unaware of urgent security issues in a timely manner, posing a security risk to the software. Presently, most of the existing works for vulnerability fix identification only consider the changed code as a sequential textual sequence, ignoring the structural information of the code. In this paper, we propose GRAPE, a GRAph-based Patch rEpresentation that aims to 1) provide a unified framework for getting vulnerability fix patches representation; and 2) enhance the understanding of the intent and potential impact of patches by extracting structural information of the code. GRAPE employs a novel joint graph structure (MCPG) to represent the syntactic and semantic information of fix patches and embeds both nodes and edges. Subsequently, a carefully designed graph convolutional neural network (NE-GCN) is utilized to fully learn structural features by leveraging the attributes of the nodes and edges. Moreover, we construct a dataset containing 2251 silent fixes. For the experimental section, we evaluated patch representation on three tasks, including vulnerability fix identification, vulnerability types classification, and vulnerability severity classification. Experimental results indicate that, in comparison to baseline methods, GRAPE can more effectively reduce false positives and omissions of vulnerability fixes identification and provide accurate vulnerability assessments."
Vision-driven UAV River Following: Benchmarking with Safe Reinforcement Learning,"In this study, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of the Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) algorithms for the task of vision-driven river following of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a Unity-based photo-realistic simulation environment. We empirically validate the effectiveness of semantic-augmented image encoding method, assessing its superiority based on Relative Entropy and the quality of water pixel reconstruction. The determination of the encoding dimension, guided by reconstruction loss, contributes to a more compact state representation, facilitating the training of Safe RL policies. Across all benchmarked Safe RL algorithms, we find that First Order Constrained Optimization in Policy Space achieves the optimal balance between reward acquisition and safety compliance. Notably, our results reveal that on-policy algorithms consistently outperform both off-policy and model-based counterparts in both training and testing environments. Importantly, the benchmarking outcomes and the vision encoding methodology extend beyond UAVs, and are applicable to Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) engaged in autonomous navigation in confined waters."
CasDyF-Net: Image Dehazing via Cascaded Dynamic Filters,"Image dehazing aims to restore image clarity and visual quality by reducing atmospheric scattering and absorption effects. While deep learning has made significant strides in this area, more and more methods are constrained by network depth. Consequently, lots of approaches have adopted parallel branching strategies. however, they often prioritize aspects such as resolution, receptive field, or frequency domain segmentation without dynamically partitioning branches based on the distribution of input features. Inspired by dynamic filtering, we propose using cascaded dynamic filters to create a multi-branch network by dynamically generating filter kernels based on feature map distribution. To better handle branch features, we propose a residual multiscale block (RMB), combining different receptive fields. Furthermore, we also introduce a dynamic convolution-based local fusion method to merge features from adjacent branches. Experiments on RESIDE, Haze4K, and O-Haze datasets validate our method's effectiveness, with our model achieving a PSNR of 43.21dB on the RESIDE-Indoor dataset.

Exploiting Supervised Poison Vulnerability to Strengthen Self-Supervised Defense,"Availability poisons exploit supervised learning (SL) algorithms by introducing class-related shortcut features in images such that models trained on poisoned data are useless for real-world datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which utilizes augmentations to learn instance discrimination, is regarded as a strong defense against poisoned data. However, by extending the study of SSL across multiple poisons on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 datasets, we demonstrate that it often performs poorly, far below that of training on clean data. Leveraging the vulnerability of SL to poison attacks, we introduce adversarial training (AT) on SL to obfuscate poison features and guide robust feature learning for SSL. Our proposed defense, designated VESPR (Vulnerability Exploitation of Supervised Poisoning for Robust SSL), surpasses the performance of six previous defenses across seven popular availability poisons. VESPR displays superior performance over all previous defenses, boosting the minimum and average ImageNet-100 test accuracies of poisoned models by 16% and 9%, respectively. Through analysis and ablation studies, we elucidate the mechanisms by which VESPR learns robust class features."
Identifying Human Indoor Daily Life Behavior employing Thermal Sensor Arrays (TSAs),"Daily activity monitoring systems used in households provide vital information for health status, particularly with aging residents. Multiple approaches have been introduced to achieve such goals, typically obtrusive and non-obtrusive. Amongst the obtrusive approaches are the wearable devices, and among the non-obtrusive approaches are the movement detection systems, including motion sensors and thermal sensor arrays (TSAs). TSA systems are advantageous when preserving a person's privacy and picking his precise spatial location. In this study, human daily living activities were monitored day and night, constructing the corresponding activity time series and spatial probability distribution and employing a TSA system. The monitored activities are classified into two categories: sleeping and daily activity. Results showed the possibility of distinguishing between classes regardless of day and night. The obtained sleep activity duration was compared with previous research using the same raw data. Results showed that the duration of sleep activity, on average, was 9 hours/day, and daily life activity was 7 hours/day. The person's spatial probability distribution was determined using the bivariate distribution for the monitored location. In conclusion, the results showed that sleeping activity was dominant. Our study showed that TSAs were the optimum choice when monitoring human activity. Our proposed approach tackled limitations encountered by previous human activity monitoring systems, such as preserving human privacy while knowing his precise spatial location."
Three-dimensional Nonlinear Path-following Guidance with Bounded Input Constraints,"In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately."
Lecture note on inverse problems and reconstruction methods,"The area of inverse problems in mathematics is highly interdisciplinary. In various fields of science, engineering, medicine, and industry, there arises a need to reconstruct information about unknown entities that cannot be directly observed. Examples include medical imaging techniques such as X-ray CT and optical tomography. Indeed, the mathematics of inverse problems has often originated from challenges posed by other fields. Inverse problems are often ill-posed and solutions are unstable. In this lecture, we will explore methods to solve such inverse problems."
Enhancing Privacy in ControlNet and Stable Diffusion via Split Learning,"With the emerging trend of large generative models, ControlNet is introduced to enable users to fine-tune pre-trained models with their own data for various use cases. A natural question arises: how can we train ControlNet models while ensuring users' data privacy across distributed devices? Exploring different distributed training schemes, we find conventional federated learning and split learning unsuitable. Instead, we propose a new distributed learning structure that eliminates the need for the server to send gradients back. Through a comprehensive evaluation of existing threats, we discover that in the context of training ControlNet with split learning, most existing attacks are ineffective, except for two mentioned in previous literature. To counter these threats, we leverage the properties of diffusion models and design a new timestep sampling policy during forward processes. We further propose a privacy-preserving activation function and a method to prevent private text prompts from leaving clients, tailored for image generation with diffusion models. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms and systems greatly enhance the efficiency of distributed training for ControlNet while ensuring users' data privacy without compromising image generation quality."
Common revenue allocation in DMUs with two stages based on DEA cross-efficiency and cooperative game,"In this paper, we examine two-stage production organizations as decision-making units (DMUs) that can collaborate to form alliances. We present a novel approach to transform a grand coalition of n DMUs with a two-stage structure into 2n single-stage sub-DMUs by extending the vectors of the initial input, intermediate product, and final output, thus creating a 2n*2n DEA cross-efficiency (CREE) matrix. By combining cooperative game theory with CREE and utilizing three cooperative game solution concepts, namely, the nucleolus, the least core and the Shapley value, a characteristic function is developed to account for two types of allocation, i.e., direct allocation and secondary allocation. Moreover, the super-additivity and the core non-emptiness properties are explored. It is found that the sum of the revenue allocated to all DMUs will remain constant at each stage regardless of the allocation manner and the cooperative solution concept selected. To illustrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach, both a numerical example and an empirical application are provided."
PSTNet: Enhanced Polyp Segmentation with Multi-scale Alignment and Frequency Domain Integration,"Accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images is crucial for effective diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, current deep learning-based methods primarily rely on fusing RGB information across multiple scales, leading to limitations in accurately identifying polyps due to restricted RGB domain information and challenges in feature misalignment during multi-scale aggregation. To address these limitations, we propose the Polyp Segmentation Network with Shunted Transformer (PSTNet), a novel approach that integrates both RGB and frequency domain cues present in the images. PSTNet comprises three key modules: the Frequency Characterization Attention Module (FCAM) for extracting frequency cues and capturing polyp characteristics, the Feature Supplementary Alignment Module (FSAM) for aligning semantic information and reducing misalignment noise, and the Cross Perception localization Module (CPM) for synergizing frequency cues with high-level semantics to achieve efficient polyp segmentation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate PSTNet's significant improvement in polyp segmentation accuracy across various metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The integration of frequency domain cues and the novel architectural design of PSTNet contribute to advancing computer-assisted polyp segmentation, facilitating more accurate diagnosis and management of CRC."
Cross-conditioned Diffusion Model for Medical Image to Image Translation,"Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides rich, complementary information for analyzing diseases. However, the practical challenges of acquiring multiple MRI modalities, such as cost, scan time, and safety considerations, often result in incomplete datasets. This affects both the quality of diagnosis and the performance of deep learning models trained on such data. Recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and denoising diffusion models have shown promise in natural and medical image-to-image translation tasks. However, the complexity of training GANs and the computational expense associated with diffusion models hinder their development and application in this task. To address these issues, we introduce a Cross-conditioned Diffusion Model (CDM) for medical image-to-image translation. The core idea of CDM is to use the distribution of target modalities as guidance to improve synthesis quality while achieving higher generation efficiency compared to conventional diffusion models. First, we propose a Modality-specific Representation Model (MRM) to model the distribution of target modalities. Then, we design a Modality-decoupled Diffusion Network (MDN) to efficiently and effectively learn the distribution from MRM. Finally, a Cross-conditioned UNet (C-UNet) with a Condition Embedding module is designed to synthesize the target modalities with the source modalities as input and the target distribution for guidance. Extensive experiments conducted on the BraTS2023 and UPenn-GBM benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method."
Incorporating Procedural Fairness in Flag Submissions on Social Media Platforms,"Flagging mechanisms on social media platforms allow users to report inappropriate posts/accounts for review by content moderators. These reports are pivotal to platforms' efforts toward regulating norm violations. This paper examines how platforms' design choices in implementing flagging mechanisms influence flaggers' perceptions of content moderation. We conducted a survey experiment asking US respondents (N=2,936) to flag inappropriate posts using one of 54 randomly assigned flagging implementations. After flagging, participants rated their fairness perceptions of the flag submission process along the dimensions of consistency, transparency, and voice (agency). We found that participants perceived greater transparency when flagging interfaces included community guidelines and greater voice when they incorporated a text box for open-ended feedback. Our qualitative analysis highlights user needs for improved accessibility, educational support for reporting, and protections against false flags. We offer design recommendations for building fairer flagging systems without exacerbating the cognitive burden of submitting flags."
Consumable Data via Quantum Communication,"Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$.   For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications."
WheelPoser: Sparse-IMU Based Body Pose Estimation for Wheelchair Users,"Despite researchers having extensively studied various ways to track body pose on-the-go, most prior work does not take into account wheelchair users, leading to poor tracking performance. Wheelchair users could greatly benefit from this pose information to prevent injuries, monitor their health, identify environmental accessibility barriers, and interact with gaming and VR experiences. In this work, we present WheelPoser, a real-time pose estimation system specifically designed for wheelchair users. Our system uses only four strategically placed IMUs on the user's body and wheelchair, making it far more practical than prior systems using cameras and dense IMU arrays. WheelPoser is able to track a wheelchair user's pose with a mean joint angle error of 14.30 degrees and a mean joint position error of 6.74 cm, more than three times better than similar systems using sparse IMUs. To train our system, we collect a novel WheelPoser-IMU dataset, consisting of 167 minutes of paired IMU sensor and motion capture data of people in wheelchairs, including wheelchair-specific motions such as propulsion and pressure relief. Finally, we explore the potential application space enabled by our system and discuss future opportunities. Open-source code, models, and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/axle-lab/WheelPoser."
Intelligent LiDAR Navigation: Leveraging External Information and Semantic Maps with LLM as Copilot,"Traditional robot navigation systems primarily utilize occupancy grid maps and laser-based sensing technologies, as demonstrated by the popular move_base package in ROS. Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which posses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems. Our code, demo, map, experiment results can be accessed at https://github.com/xiexiexiaoxiexie/Intelligent-LiDAR-Navigation-LLM-as-Copilot."
Tri-Plane Mamba: Efficiently Adapting Segment Anything Model for 3D Medical Images,"General networks for 3D medical image segmentation have recently undergone extensive exploration. Behind the exceptional performance of these networks lies a significant demand for a large volume of pixel-level annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emergence of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has enabled this model to achieve superior performance in 2D medical image segmentation tasks via parameter- and data-efficient feature adaptation. However, the introduction of additional depth channels in 3D medical images not only prevents the sharing of 2D pre-trained features but also results in a quadratic increase in the computational cost for adapting SAM. To overcome these challenges, we present the Tri-Plane Mamba (TP-Mamba) adapters tailored for the SAM, featuring two major innovations: 1) multi-scale 3D convolutional adapters, optimized for efficiently processing local depth-level information, 2) a tri-plane mamba module, engineered to capture long-range depth-level representation without significantly increasing computational costs. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D CT organ segmentation tasks. Remarkably, this superior performance is maintained even with scarce training data. Specifically using only three CT training samples from the BTCV dataset, it surpasses conventional 3D segmentation networks, attaining a Dice score that is up to 12% higher."
The common revenue allocation based on modified Shapley value and DEA cross-efficiency,"How to design a fair and reasonable allocation plan for the common revenue of the alliance is considered in this paper. We regard the common revenue to be allocated as an exogenous variable which will not participate in the subsequent production process. The production organizations can cooperate with each other and form alliances. As the DEA cross-efficiency combines self- and peer-evaluation mechanisms, and the cooperative game allows fair negotiation among participants, we combine the cross-efficiency with the cooperative game theory and construct the modified Shapley value to reflect the contribution of the evaluated participant to the alliance. In addition, for each participant, both the optimistic and the pessimistic modified Shapley values are considered, and thus the upper and lower bounds of the allocation revenue are obtained, correspondingly. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the operation procedure. Finally, we apply the approach to an empirical application concerning a city commercial bank with 18 branches in China."
Confidence Calibration for Audio Captioning Models,"Systems that automatically generate text captions for audio, images and video lack a confidence indicator of the relevance and correctness of the generated sequences. To address this, we build on existing methods of confidence measurement for text by introduce selective pooling of token probabilities, which aligns better with traditional correctness measures than conventional pooling does. Further, we propose directly measuring the similarity between input audio and text in a shared embedding space. To measure self-consistency, we adapt semantic entropy for audio captioning, and find that these two methods align even better than pooling-based metrics with the correctness measure that calculates acoustic similarity between captions. Finally, we explain why temperature scaling of confidences improves calibration."
Hierarchical Learning Framework for Whole-Body Model Predictive Control of a Real Humanoid Robot,"The simulation-to-real gap problem and the high computational burden of whole-body Model Predictive Control (whole-body MPC) continue to present challenges in generating a wide variety of movements using whole-body MPC for real humanoid robots. This paper presents a biologically-inspired hierarchical learning framework as a potential solution to the aforementioned problems. The proposed three-layer hierarchical framework enables the generation of multi-contact, dynamic behaviours even with low-frequency policy updates of whole-body MPC. The upper layer is responsible for learning an accurate dynamics model with the objective of reducing the discrepancy between the analytical model and the real system. This enables the computation of effective control policies using whole-body MPC. Subsequently, the middle and lower layers are tasked with learning additional policies to generate high-frequency control inputs. In order to learn an accurate dynamics model in the upper layer, an augmented model using a deep residual network is trained by model-based reinforcement learning with stochastic whole-body MPC. The proposed framework was evaluated in 10 distinct motion learning scenarios, including jogging on a flat surface and skating on curved surfaces. The results demonstrate that a wide variety of motions can be successfully generated on a real humanoid robot using whole-body MPC through learning with the proposed framework."
Sub-graph Based Diffusion Model for Link Prediction,"Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent a contemporary class of generative models with exceptional qualities in both synthesis and maximizing the data likelihood. These models work by traversing a forward Markov Chain where data is perturbed, followed by a reverse process where a neural network learns to undo the perturbations and recover the original data. There have been increasing efforts exploring the applications of DDPMs in the graph domain. However, most of them have focused on the generative perspective. In this paper, we aim to build a novel generative model for link prediction. In particular, we treat link prediction between a pair of nodes as a conditional likelihood estimation of its enclosing sub-graph. With a dedicated design to decompose the likelihood estimation process via the Bayesian formula, we are able to separate the estimation of sub-graph structure and its node features. Such designs allow our model to simultaneously enjoy the advantages of inductive learning and the strong generalization capability. Remarkably, comprehensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed method presents numerous advantages: (1) transferability across datasets without retraining, (2) promising generalization on limited training data, and (3) robustness against graph adversarial attacks."
Can AI Prompt Humans? Multimodal Agents Prompt Players' Game Actions and Show Consequences to Raise Sustainability Awareness,"Unsustainable behaviors are challenging to prevent due to their long-term, often unclear consequences. Games offer a promising solution by creating artificial environments where players can immediately experience the outcomes of their actions. To explore this potential, we developed EcoEcho, a GenAI-powered game leveraging multimodal agents to raise sustainability awareness. These agents engage players in natural conversations, prompting them to take in-game actions that lead to visible environmental impacts. We evaluated EcoEcho using a mixed-methods approach with 23 participants. Results show a significant increase in intended sustainable behaviors post-game, although attitudes towards sustainability only slightly improved. This finding highlights the potential of multimodal agents and action-consequence mechanics to effectively motivate real-world behavioral changes such as raising environmental sustainability awareness."
A BERT-Based Summarization approach for depression detection,"Depression is a globally prevalent mental disorder with potentially severe repercussions if not addressed, especially in individuals with recurrent episodes. Prior research has shown that early intervention has the potential to mitigate or alleviate symptoms of depression. However, implementing such interventions in a real-world setting may pose considerable challenges. A promising strategy involves leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to autonomously detect depression indicators from diverse data sources. One of the most widely available and informative data sources is text, which can reveal a person's mood, thoughts, and feelings. In this context, virtual agents programmed to conduct interviews using clinically validated questionnaires, such as those found in the DAIC-WOZ dataset, offer a robust means for depression detection through linguistic analysis. Utilizing BERT-based models, which are powerful and versatile yet use fewer resources than contemporary large language models, to convert text into numerical representations significantly enhances the precision of depression diagnosis. These models adeptly capture complex semantic and syntactic nuances, improving the detection accuracy of depressive symptoms. Given the inherent limitations of these models concerning text length, our study proposes text summarization as a preprocessing technique to diminish the length and intricacies of input texts. Implementing this method within our uniquely developed framework for feature extraction and classification yielded an F1-score of 0.67 on the test set surpassing all prior benchmarks and 0.81 on the validation set exceeding most previous results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Furthermore, we have devised a depression lexicon to assess summary quality and relevance. This lexicon constitutes a valuable asset for ongoing research in depression detection."
Risks When Sharing LoRA Fine-Tuned Diffusion Model Weights,"With the emerging trend in generative models and convenient public access to diffusion models pre-trained on large datasets, users can fine-tune these models to generate images of personal faces or items in new contexts described by natural language. Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the most common way to save memory and computation usage on the user end during fine-tuning. However, a natural question is whether the private images used for fine-tuning will be leaked to adversaries when sharing model weights. In this paper, we study the issue of privacy leakage of a fine-tuned diffusion model in a practical setting, where adversaries only have access to model weights, rather than prompts or images used for fine-tuning. We design and build a variational network autoencoder that takes model weights as input and outputs the reconstruction of private images. To improve the efficiency of training such an autoencoder, we propose a training paradigm with the help of timestep embedding. The results give a surprising answer to this research question: an adversary can generate images containing the same identities as the private images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no existing defense method, including differential privacy-based methods, can preserve the privacy of private data used for fine-tuning a diffusion model without compromising the utility of a fine-tuned model."
USTC-TD: A Test Dataset and Benchmark for Image and Video Coding in 2020s,"Image/video coding has been a remarkable research area for both academia and industry for many years. Testing datasets, especially high-quality image/video datasets are desirable for the justified evaluation of coding-related research, practical applications, and standardization activities. We put forward a test dataset namely USTC-TD, which has been successfully adopted in the practical end-to-end image/video coding challenge of the IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing in 2022 and 2023. USTC-TD contains 40 images at 4K spatial resolution and 10 video sequences at 1080p spatial resolution, featuring various content due to the diverse environmental factors (scene type, texture, motion, view) and the designed imaging factors (illumination, shadow, lens). We quantitatively evaluate USTC-TD on different image/video features (spatial, temporal, color, lightness), and compare it with the previous image/video test datasets, which verifies the wider coverage and more diversity of the proposed dataset. We also evaluate both classic standardized and recent learned image/video coding schemes on USTC-TD with PSNR and MS-SSIM, and provide an extensive benchmark for the evaluated schemes. Based on the characteristics and specific design of the proposed test dataset, we analyze the benchmark performance and shed light on the future research and development of image/video coding. All the data are released online: https://esakak.github.io/USTC-TD."
The Immersed Weak Galerkin and Continuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problem,"In this paper, we use the weak Galerkin finite element method to solve the elliptic interface problem on interface-independent meshes. In the interface element, we use the immersed finite element (IFE) functions satisfying the interface conditions precisely and they have optimal approximation capabilities. In the non-interface element, the continuous element is employed to approximate the exact solution. The optimal convergence orders of error are obtained in the $H^1$ norm and $L^2$ norm. A series of numerical experiments are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method."
Exploring Information Retrieval Landscapes: An Investigation of a Novel Evaluation Techniques and Comparative Document Splitting Methods,"The performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in information retrieval is significantly influenced by the characteristics of the documents being processed. In this study, the structured nature of textbooks, the conciseness of articles, and the narrative complexity of novels are shown to require distinct retrieval strategies. A comparative evaluation of multiple document-splitting methods reveals that the Recursive Character Splitter outperforms the Token-based Splitter in preserving contextual integrity. A novel evaluation technique is introduced, utilizing an open-source model to generate a comprehensive dataset of question-and-answer pairs, simulating realistic retrieval scenarios to enhance testing efficiency and metric reliability. The evaluation employs weighted scoring metrics, including SequenceMatcher, BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score, to assess the system's accuracy and relevance. This approach establishes a refined standard for evaluating the precision of RAG systems, with future research focusing on optimizing chunk and overlap sizes to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency."
Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling,"We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content. See our project page: vivekoommen.github.io/NO_DM"
Research on Data Right Confirmation Mechanism of Federated Learning based on Blockchain,"Federated learning can solve the privacy protection problem in distributed data mining and machine learning, and how to protect the ownership, use and income rights of all parties involved in federated learning is an important issue. This paper proposes a federated learning data ownership confirmation mechanism based on blockchain and smart contract, which uses decentralized blockchain technology to save the contribution of each participant on the blockchain, and distributes the benefits of federated learning results through the blockchain. In the local simulation environment of the blockchain, the relevant smart contracts and data structures are simulated and implemented, and the feasibility of the scheme is preliminarily demonstrated."
RT-DETRv3: Real-time End-to-End Object Detection with Hierarchical Dense Positive Supervision,"RT-DETR is the first real-time end-to-end transformer-based object detector. Its efficiency comes from the framework design and the Hungarian matching. However, compared to dense supervision detectors like the YOLO series, the Hungarian matching provides much sparser supervision, leading to insufficient model training and difficult to achieve optimal results. To address these issues, we proposed a hierarchical dense positive supervision method based on RT-DETR, named RT-DETRv3. Firstly, we introduce a CNN-based auxiliary branch that provides dense supervision that collaborates with the original decoder to enhance the encoder feature representation. Secondly, to address insufficient decoder training, we propose a novel learning strategy involving self-attention perturbation. This strategy diversifies label assignment for positive samples across multiple query groups, thereby enriching positive supervisions. Additionally, we introduce a shared-weight decoder branch for dense positive supervision to ensure more high-quality queries matching each ground truth. Notably, all aforementioned modules are training-only. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on COCO val2017. RT-DETRv3 significantly outperforms existing real-time detectors, including the RT-DETR series and the YOLO series. For example, RT-DETRv3-R18 achieves 48.1% AP (+1.6%/+1.4%) compared to RT-DETR-R18/RT-DETRv2-R18 while maintaining the same latency. Meanwhile, it requires only half of epochs to attain a comparable performance. Furthermore, RT-DETRv3-R101 can attain an impressive 54.6% AP outperforming YOLOv10-X. Code will be released soon."
Rethinking Meta-Learning from a Learning Lens,"Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful approach for leveraging knowledge from previous tasks to solve new tasks. The mainstream methods focus on training a well-generalized model initialization, which is then adapted to different tasks with limited data and updates. However, it pushes the model overfitting on the training tasks. Previous methods mainly attributed this to the lack of data and used augmentations to address this issue, but they were limited by sufficient training and effective augmentation strategies. In this work, we focus on the more fundamental ``learning to learn'' strategy of meta-learning to explore what causes errors and how to eliminate these errors without changing the environment. Specifically, we first rethink the algorithmic procedure of meta-learning from a ``learning'' lens. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that (i) this paradigm faces the risk of both overfitting and underfitting and (ii) the model adapted to different tasks promote each other where the effect is stronger if the tasks are more similar. Based on this insight, we propose using task relations to calibrate the optimization process of meta-learning and propose a plug-and-play method called Task Relation Learner (TRLearner) to achieve this goal. Specifically, it first obtains task relation matrices from the extracted task-specific meta-data. Then, it uses the obtained matrices with relation-aware consistency regularization to guide optimization. Extensive theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of TRLearner."
Stark Decline in Journalists' Use of Preprints Post-pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of preprints, aiding rapid research dissemination but also facilitating the spread of misinformation. This study analyzes media coverage of preprints from 2014 to 2023, revealing a significant post-pandemic decline. Our findings suggest that heightened awareness of the risks associated with preprints has led to more cautious media practices. While the decline in preprint coverage may mitigate concerns about premature media exposure, it also raises questions about the future role of preprints in science communication, especially during emergencies. Balanced policies based on up-to-date evidence are needed to address this shift."
An Intent Modeling and Inference Framework for Autonomous and Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems,"An intent modelling and inference framework is presented to assist the defense planning for protecting a geo-fence against unauthorized flights. First, a novel mathematical definition for the intent of an uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) is presented. The concepts of critical waypoints and critical waypoint patterns are introduced and associated with a motion process to fully characterize an intent. This modelling framework consists of representations of a UAS mission planner, used to plan the aircraft's motion sequence, as well as a defense planner, defined to protect the geo-fence. It is applicable to autonomous, semi-autonomous, and piloted systems in 2D and 3D environments with obstacles. The framework is illustrated by defining a library of intents for a security application. Detection and tracking of the target are presumed for formulating the intent inference problem. Multiple formulations of the decision maker's objective are discussed as part of a deep-learning-based methodology. Further, a multi-modal dynamic model for characterizing the UAS flight is discussed. This is later utilized to extract features using the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter for training the intent classifier. Finally, as part of the simulation study, an attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for intent inference is presented. The simulation experiments illustrate various aspects of the framework, including trajectory generation, radar measurement simulation, etc., in 2D and 3D environments."
Improved Finite-Particle Convergence Rates for Stein Variational Gradient Descent,"We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernel Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is the observation that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, providing a near optimal double exponential improvement over the recent result by~\cite{shi2024finite}. Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow linearly in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws."
Generalization Boosted Adapter for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable open-vocabulary object recognition capabilities, motivating their adaptation for dense prediction tasks like segmentation. However, directly applying VLMs to such tasks remains challenging due to their lack of pixel-level granularity and the limited data available for fine-tuning, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Generalization Boosted Adapter (GBA), a novel adapter strategy that enhances the generalization and robustness of VLMs for open-vocabulary segmentation. GBA comprises two core components: (1) a Style Diversification Adapter (SDA) that decouples features into amplitude and phase components, operating solely on the amplitude to enrich the feature space representation while preserving semantic consistency; and (2) a Correlation Constraint Adapter (CCA) that employs cross-attention to establish tighter semantic associations between text categories and target regions, suppressing irrelevant low-frequency ``noise'' information and avoiding erroneous associations. Through the synergistic effect of the shallow SDA and the deep CCA, GBA effectively alleviates overfitting issues and enhances the semantic relevance of feature representations. As a simple, efficient, and plug-and-play component, GBA can be flexibly integrated into various CLIP-based methods, demonstrating broad applicability and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks."
Explaining Datasets in Words: Statistical Models with Natural Language Parameters,"To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate ""discusses COVID"". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce."
VLTP: Vision-Language Guided Token Pruning for Task-Oriented Segmentation,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the backbone of many segmentation models, consistently achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, their success comes at a significant computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the most effective strategies to address this complexity. However, previous approaches fall short when applied to more complex task-oriented segmentation (TOS), where the class of each image patch is not predefined but dependent on the specific input task. This work introduces the Vision Language Guided Token Pruning (VLTP), a novel token pruning mechanism that can accelerate ViTbased segmentation models, particularly for TOS guided by multi-modal large language model (MLLM). We argue that ViT does not need to process every image token through all of its layers only the tokens related to reasoning tasks are necessary. We design a new pruning decoder to take both image tokens and vision-language guidance as input to predict the relevance of each image token to the task. Only image tokens with high relevance are passed to deeper layers of the ViT. Experiments show that the VLTP framework reduces the computational costs of ViT by approximately 25% without performance degradation and by around 40% with only a 1% performance drop."
"Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics","The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.   M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.   We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy."
VistaFormer: Scalable Vision Transformers for Satellite Image Time Series Segmentation,"We introduce VistaFormer, a lightweight Transformer-based model architecture for the semantic segmentation of remote-sensing images. This model uses a multi-scale Transformer-based encoder with a lightweight decoder that aggregates global and local attention captured in the encoder blocks. VistaFormer uses position-free self-attention layers which simplifies the model architecture and removes the need to interpolate temporal and spatial codes, which can reduce model performance when training and testing image resolutions differ. We investigate simple techniques for filtering noisy input signals like clouds and demonstrate that improved model scalability can be achieved by substituting Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) with Neighbourhood Attention (NA). Experiments on the PASTIS and MTLCC crop-type segmentation benchmarks show that VistaFormer achieves better performance than comparable models and requires only 8% of the floating point operations using MHSA and 11% using NA while also using fewer trainable parameters. VistaFormer with MHSA improves on state-of-the-art mIoU scores by 0.1% on the PASTIS benchmark and 3% on the MTLCC benchmark while VistaFormer with NA improves on the MTLCC benchmark by 3.7%."
Toward satisfactory public accessibility: A crowdsourcing approach through online reviews to inclusive urban design,"As urban populations grow, the need for accessible urban design has become urgent. Traditional survey methods for assessing public perceptions of accessibility are often limited in scope. Crowdsourcing via online reviews offers a valuable alternative to understanding public perceptions, and advancements in large language models can facilitate their use. This study uses Google Maps reviews across the United States and fine-tunes Llama 3 model with the Low-Rank Adaptation technique to analyze public sentiment on accessibility. At the POI level, most categories -- restaurants, retail, hotels, and healthcare -- show negative sentiments. Socio-spatial analysis reveals that areas with higher proportions of white residents and greater socioeconomic status report more positive sentiment, while areas with more elderly, highly-educated residents exhibit more negative sentiment. Interestingly, no clear link is found between the presence of disabilities and public sentiments. Overall, this study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing for identifying accessibility challenges and providing insights for urban planners."
Inter Observer Variability Assessment through Ordered Weighted Belief Divergence Measure in MAGDM Application to the Ensemble Classifier Feature Fusion,"A large number of multi-attribute group decisionmaking (MAGDM) have been widely introduced to obtain consensus results. However, most of the methodologies ignore the conflict among the experts opinions and only consider equal or variable priorities of them. Therefore, this study aims to propose an Evidential MAGDM method by assessing the inter-observational variability and handling uncertainty that emerges between the experts. The proposed framework has fourfold contributions. First, the basic probability assignment (BPA) generation method is introduced to consider the inherent characteristics of each alternative by computing the degree of belief. Second, the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure is constructed to capture the overall intrinsic information of the alternative by assessing the inter-observational variability and addressing the conflicts emerging between the group of experts. An ordered weighted belief divergence measure is constructed to acquire the weighted support for each group of experts to obtain the final preference relationship. Finally, we have shown an illustrative example of the proposed Evidential MAGDM framework. Further, we have analyzed the interpretation of Evidential MAGDM in the real-world application for ensemble classifier feature fusion to diagnose retinal disorders using optical coherence tomography images."
Beyond Functionality: Co-Designing Voice User Interfaces for Older Adults' Well-being,"The global population is rapidly aging, necessitating technologies that promote healthy aging. Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), leveraging natural language interaction, offer a promising solution for older adults due to their ease of use. However, current design practices often overemphasize functionality, neglecting older adults' complex aspirations, psychological well-being, and social connectedness. To address this gap, we conducted co-design sessions with 20 older adults employing an empathic design approach. Half of the participants interacted with a probe involving health information learning, while the others focused on a probe related to exercise. This method engaged participants in collaborative activities to uncover non-functional requirements early in the design process. Results indicate that when encouraged to share their needs within a social context, older adults revealed a range of sensory, aesthetic, hedonic, and social preferences and, more importantly, the specific personas of VUIs. These insights inform the relative importance of these factors in VUI design."
An Entropy-Based Test and Development Framework for Uncertainty Modeling in Level-Set Visualizations,"We present a simple comparative framework for testing and developing uncertainty modeling in uncertain marching cubes implementations. The selection of a model to represent the probability distribution of uncertain values directly influences the memory use, run time, and accuracy of an uncertainty visualization algorithm. We use an entropy calculation directly on ensemble data to establish an expected result and then compare the entropy from various probability models, including uniform, Gaussian, histogram, and quantile models. Our results verify that models matching the distribution of the ensemble indeed match the entropy. We further show that fewer bins in nonparametric histogram models are more effective whereas large numbers of bins in quantile models approach data accuracy."
Towards Unified Facial Action Unit Recognition Framework by Large Language Models,"Facial Action Units (AUs) are of great significance in the realm of affective computing. In this paper, we propose AU-LLaVA, the first unified AU recognition framework based on the Large Language Model (LLM). AU-LLaVA consists of a visual encoder, a linear projector layer, and a pre-trained LLM. We meticulously craft the text descriptions and fine-tune the model on various AU datasets, allowing it to generate different formats of AU recognition results for the same input image. On the BP4D and DISFA datasets, AU-LLaVA delivers the most accurate recognition results for nearly half of the AUs. Our model achieves improvements of F1-score up to 11.4% in specific AU recognition compared to previous benchmark results. On the FEAFA dataset, our method achieves significant improvements over all 24 AUs compared to previous benchmark results. AU-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional performance and versatility in AU recognition."
CF-PRNet: Coarse-to-Fine Prototype Refining Network for Point Cloud Completion and Reconstruction,"In modern agriculture, precise monitoring of plants and fruits is crucial for tasks such as high-throughput phenotyping and automated harvesting. This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing accurate 3D shapes of fruits from partial views, which is common in agricultural settings. We introduce CF-PRNet, a coarse-to-fine prototype refining network, leverages high-resolution 3D data during the training phase but requires only a single RGB-D image for real-time inference. Our approach begins by extracting the incomplete point cloud data that constructed from a partial view of a fruit with a series of convolutional blocks. The extracted features inform the generation of scaling vectors that refine two sequentially constructed 3D mesh prototypes - one coarse and one fine-grained. This progressive refinement facilitates the detailed completion of the final point clouds, achieving detailed and accurate reconstructions. CF-PRNet demonstrates excellent performance metrics with a Chamfer Distance of 3.78, an F1 Score of 66.76%, a Precision of 56.56%, and a Recall of 85.31%, and win the first place in the Shape Completion and Reconstruction of Sweet Peppers Challenge."
A Simple 4-Approximation Algorithm for Maximum Agreement Forests on Multiple Unrooted Binary Trees,"We present a simple 4-approximation algorithm for computing a maximum agreement forest of multiple unrooted binary trees. This algorithm applies LP rounding to an extension of a recent ILP formulation of the maximum agreement forest problem on two trees by Van Wersch al. We achieve the same approximation ratio as the algorithm of Chen et al. but our algorithm is extremely simple. We also prove that no algorithm based on the ILP formulation by Van Wersch et al. can achieve an approximation ratio of $4 - \varepsilon$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, even on two trees. To this end, we prove that the integrality gap of the ILP approaches 4 as the size of the two input trees grows."
Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space,"Even though a variety of methods (e.g., RL, MPC, LQR) have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control of physical systems remains an open challenge. A promising avenue would be to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems. Furthermore, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it presses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, (iii) we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iv) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we leverage these four properties and show that they enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information."
When Context Leads but Parametric Memory Follows in Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in leveraging diverse knowledge sources. This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance."
Predictive Control and Regret Analysis of Non-Stationary MDP with Look-ahead Information,"Policy design in non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is inherently challenging due to the complexities introduced by time-varying system transition and reward, which make it difficult for learners to determine the optimal actions for maximizing cumulative future rewards. Fortunately, in many practical applications, such as energy systems, look-ahead predictions are available, including forecasts for renewable energy generation and demand. In this paper, we leverage these look-ahead predictions and propose an algorithm designed to achieve low regret in non-stationary MDPs by incorporating such predictions. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, the regret decreases exponentially as the look-ahead window expands. When the system prediction is subject to error, the regret does not explode even if the prediction error grows sub-exponentially as a function of the prediction horizon. We validate our approach through simulations, confirming the efficacy of our algorithm in non-stationary environments."
Global and Distributed Reproduction Numbers of a Multilayer SIR Model with an Infrastructure Network,"In this paper, we propose an SIR spread model in a population network coupled with an infrastructure network that has a pathogen spreading in it. We develop a threshold condition to characterize the monotonicity and peak time of a weighted average of the infection states in terms of the global (network-wide) effective reproduction number. We further define the distributed reproduction numbers (DRNs) of each node in the multilayer network which are used to provide local threshold conditions for the dynamical behavior of each entity. Furthermore, we leverage the DRNs to predict the global behavior based on the node-level assumptions. We use both analytical and simulation results to illustrate that the DRNs allow a more accurate analysis of the networked spreading process than the global effective reproduction number."
SoloAudio: Target Sound Extraction with Language-oriented Audio Diffusion Transformer,"In this paper, we introduce SoloAudio, a novel diffusion-based generative model for target sound extraction (TSE). Our approach trains latent diffusion models on audio, replacing the previous U-Net backbone with a skip-connected Transformer that operates on latent features. SoloAudio supports both audio-oriented and language-oriented TSE by utilizing a CLAP model as the feature extractor for target sounds. Furthermore, SoloAudio leverages synthetic audio generated by state-of-the-art text-to-audio models for training, demonstrating strong generalization to out-of-domain data and unseen sound events. We evaluate this approach on the FSD Kaggle 2018 mixture dataset and real data from AudioSet, where SoloAudio achieves the state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain data, and exhibits impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Source code and demos are released."
Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation,"In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples."
Baloo: A Large-Scale Hybrid Soft Robotic Torso for Whole-Arm Manipulation,"Soft robotic actuators and their inherent compliance can simplify the design of controllers when operating in contact-rich environments. With such structures we can accomplish high-impact, dynamic, and contact-rich tasks that would be difficult using conventional rigid robots which might either break the robot or the object without careful modeling and design of high bandwidth controllers. In order to explore the benefits of structural passive compliance and exploit them effectively, we present a prototype robotic torso named Baloo, designed with a hybrid rigid-soft methodology, incorporating both adaptability from soft components and strength from rigid components. Baloo consists of two meter-long, pneumatically-driven soft robot arms mounted on a rigid torso and driven vertically by a linear actuator. We explore some challenges inherent in controlling this type of robot and build on previous work with rigid robots to develop a joint-level neural-network adaptive controller to enable high performance tracking of highly nonlinear, time-varying soft robot dynamics. We also demonstrate a promising use case for the platform with several hardware experiments performing whole-body manipulation with large, heavy, and unwieldy objects. A video of our results can be viewed at https://youtu.be/eTUvBEVGKXY."
Introducing CausalBench: A Flexible Benchmark Framework for Causal Analysis and Machine Learning,"While witnessing the exceptional success of machine learning (ML) technologies in many applications, users are starting to notice a critical shortcoming of ML: correlation is a poor substitute for causation. The conventional way to discover causal relationships is to use randomized controlled experiments (RCT); in many situations, however, these are impractical or sometimes unethical. Causal learning from observational data offers a promising alternative. While being relatively recent, causal learning aims to go far beyond conventional machine learning, yet several major challenges remain. Unfortunately, advances are hampered due to the lack of unified benchmark datasets, algorithms, metrics, and evaluation service interfaces for causal learning. In this paper, we introduce {\em CausalBench}, a transparent, fair, and easy-to-use evaluation platform, aiming to (a) enable the advancement of research in causal learning by facilitating scientific collaboration in novel algorithms, datasets, and metrics and (b) promote scientific objectivity, reproducibility, fairness, and awareness of bias in causal learning research. CausalBench provides services for benchmarking data, algorithms, models, and metrics, impacting the needs of a broad of scientific and engineering disciplines."
Towards Scalable Quantum Networks,"This paper presents a comprehensive study on the scalability challenges and opportunities in quantum communication networks, with the goal of determining parameters that impact networks most as well as the trends that appear when scaling networks. We design simulations of quantum networks comprised of router nodes made up of trapped-ion qubits, separated by quantum repeaters in the form of Bell State Measurement (BSM) nodes. Such networks hold the promise of securely sharing quantum information and enabling high-power distributed quantum computing. Despite the promises, quantum networks encounter scalability issues due to noise and operational errors. Through a modular approach, our research aims to surmount these challenges, focusing on effects from scaling node counts and separation distances while monitoring low-quality communication arising from decoherence effects. We aim to pinpoint the critical features within networks essential for advancing scalable, large-scale quantum computing systems. Our findings underscore the impact of several network parameters on scalability, highlighting a critical insight into the trade-offs between the number of repeaters and the quality of entanglement generated. This paper lays the groundwork for future explorations into optimized quantum network designs and protocols."
A Surveillance Game between a Differential Drive Robot and an Omnidirectional Agent: The Case of a Faster Evader,"A fundamental task in mobile robotics is to keep an agent under surveillance using an autonomous robotic platform equipped with a sensing device. Using differential game theory, we study a particular setup of the previous problem. A Differential Drive Robot (DDR) equipped with a bounded range sensor wants to keep surveillance of an Omnidirectional Agent (OA). The goal of the DDR is to maintain the OA inside its detection region for as much time as possible, while the OA, having the opposite goal, wants to leave the regions as soon as possible. We formulate the problem as a zero-sum differential game, and we compute the time-optimal motion strategies of the players to achieve their goals. We focus on the case where the OA is faster than the DDR. Given the OA's speed advantage, a winning strategy for the OA is always moving radially outwards to the DDR's position. However, this work shows that even though the previous strategy could be optimal in some cases, more complex motion strategies emerge based on the players' speed ratio. In particular, we exhibit that four classes of singular surfaces may appear in this game: Dispersal, Transition, Universal, and Focal surfaces. Each one of those surfaces implies a particular motion strategy for the players."
Safety of Linear Systems under Severe Sensor Attacks,"Cyber-physical systems can be subject to sensor attacks, e.g., sensor spoofing, leading to unsafe behaviors. This paper addresses this problem in the context of linear systems when an omniscient attacker can spoof several system sensors at will. In this adversarial environment, existing results have derived necessary and sufficient conditions under which the state estimation problem has a unique solution. In this work, we consider a severe attacking scenario when such conditions do not hold. To deal with potential state estimation uncertainty, we derive an exact characterization of the set of all possible state estimates. Using the framework of control barrier functions, we propose design principles for system safety in offline and online phases. For the offline phase, we derive conditions on safe sets for all possible sensor attacks that may be encountered during system deployment. For the online phase, with past system measurements collected, a quadratic program-based safety filter is proposed to enforce system safety. A 2D-vehicle example is used to illustrate the theoretical results."
Social Equity Based Optimal Power Flow Framework to Hedge Against Price Events,"With the increasing frequency of high impact low probability events, electricity markets are experiencing significant price spikes more often. This paper proposes a novel social equity driven optimal power flow framework to mitigate the adverse effects of price events that lead to such price spikes. The framework integrates social welfare optimization with socioeconomic considerations by including a socioeconomic score that quantifies the energy burden and socioeconomic status of consumers. By incorporating both supply cost and consumer satisfaction, the model aims to achieve a balanced and fair distribution of resources during price events, while considering resource scarcity and possible load curtailment. The proposed framework is tested for convergence on modified versions of the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 24-bus reliability test system, discussing its potential effectiveness in enhancing social equity and optimizing power flow under system security constraints. Sensitivity analysis further highlights the impact of socioeconomic score on social welfare, providing insights for future improvements."
Sequential Discrete Action Selection via Blocking Conditions and Resolutions,"In this work, we introduce a strategy that frames the sequential action selection problem for robots in terms of resolving \textit{blocking conditions}, i.e., situations that impede progress on an action en route to a goal. This strategy allows a robot to make one-at-a-time decisions that take in pertinent contextual information and swiftly adapt and react to current situations. We present a first instantiation of this strategy that combines a state-transition graph and a zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM). The state-transition graph tracks which previously attempted actions are currently blocked and which candidate actions may resolve existing blocking conditions. This information from the state-transition graph is used to automatically generate a prompt for the LLM, which then uses the given context and set of possible actions to select a single action to try next. This selection process is iterative, with each chosen and executed action further refining the state-transition graph, continuing until the agent either fulfills the goal or encounters a termination condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to various LLM and traditional task-planning methods in a testbed of simulation experiments. We discuss the implications of our work based on our results."
Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Multiclass Support Vector Machine,"We study the problem of multiclass classification for settings where data features $\mathbf{x}$ and their labels $\mathbf{y}$ are uncertain. We identify that distributionally robust one-vs-all (OVA) classifiers often struggle in settings with imbalanced data. To address this issue, we use Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization to develop a robust version of the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) characterized by the Crammer-Singer (CS) loss. First, we prove that the CS loss is bounded from above by a Lipschitz continuous function for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}$, then we exploit strong duality results to express the dual of the worst-case risk problem, and we show that the worst-case risk minimization problem admits a tractable convex reformulation due to the regularity of the CS loss. Moreover, we develop a kernel version of our proposed model to account for nonlinear class separation, and we show that it admits a tractable convex upper bound. We also propose a projected subgradient method algorithm for a special case of our proposed linear model to improve scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the art OVA models in settings where the training data is highly imbalanced. We also show through experiments on popular real-world datasets that our proposed model often outperforms its regularized counterpart as the first accounts for uncertain labels unlike the latter."
Graph-Based Pulse Representation for Diverse Quantum Control Hardware,"Pulse-level control of quantum systems is critical for enabling gate implementations, calibration procedures, and Hamiltonian evolution which fundamentally are not supported by the traditional circuit model. This level of control necessitates both efficient generation and representation. In this work, we propose pulselib - a graph-based pulse-level representation. A graph structure, with nodes consisting of parametrized fundamental waveforms, stores all the high-level pulse information while staying flexible for translation into hardware-specific inputs. We motivate pulselib by comparing its feature set and information flow through the pulse layer of the software stack with currently available pulse representations. We describe the architecture of this proposed representation that mimics the abstract syntax tree (AST) model from classical compilation pipelines. Finally, we outline applications like trapped-ion-specific gate and shelving pulse schemes whose constraints and implementation can be written and represented due to pulselib's graph-based architecture."
Knowledge Tagging with Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System,"Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts."
Consistent Strong Triadic Closure in Multilayer Networks,"Social network users are commonly connected to hundreds or even thousands of other users. However, these ties are not all of equal strength; for example, we often are connected to good friends or family members as well as acquaintances. Inferring the tie strengths is an essential task in social network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties into strong and weak edges based on the network topology using the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three nodes, $\textit{A}$, $\textit{B}$, and $\textit{C}$, there are strong ties between $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{B}$, as well as $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{C}$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $\textit{B}$ and $\textit{C}$. Moreover, a variant of the STC called STC+ allows adding new weak edges to obtain improved solutions. Recently, the focus of social network analysis has been shifting from single-layer to multilayer networks due to their ability to represent complex systems with multiple types of interactions or relationships in multiple social network platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X (formerly Twitter). However, straightforwardly applying the STC separately to each layer of multilayer networks usually leads to inconsistent labelings between layers. Avoiding such inconsistencies is essential as they contradict the idea that tie strengths represent underlying, consistent truths about the relationships between users. Therefore, we adapt the definitions of the STC and STC+ for multilayer networks and provide ILP formulations to solve the problems exactly. Solving the ILPs is computationally costly; hence, we additionally provide an efficient 2-approximation for the STC and a 6-approximation for the STC+ minimization variants. The experiments show that, unlike standard approaches, our new highly efficient algorithms lead to consistent strong/weak labelings of the multilayer network edges."
Simultaneous Topology Estimation and Synchronization of Dynamical Networks with Time-varying Topology,"We propose an adaptive control strategy for the simultaneous estimation of topology and synchronization in complex dynamical networks with unknown, time-varying topology. Our approach transforms the problem of time-varying topology estimation into a problem of estimating the time-varying weights of a complete graph, utilizing an edge-agreement framework. We introduce two auxiliary networks: one that satisfies the persistent excitation condition to facilitate topology estimation, while the other, a uniform-$\delta$ persistently exciting network, ensures the boundedness of both weight estimation and synchronization errors, assuming bounded time-varying weights and their derivatives. A relevant numerical example shows the efficiency of our methods."
Customized Mid-Air Gestures for Accessibility: A $B Recognizer for Multi-Dimensional Biosignal Gestures,"Biosignal interfaces, using sensors in, on, or around the body, promise to enhance wearables interaction and improve device accessibility for people with motor disabilities. However, biosignals are multi-modal, multi-dimensional, and noisy, requiring domain expertise to design input features for gesture classifiers. The \$B-recognizer enables mid-air gesture recognition without needing expertise in biosignals or algorithms. \$B resamples, normalizes, and performs dimensionality reduction to reduce noise and enhance signals relevant to the recognition. We tested \$B on a dataset of 26 participants with and 8 participants without upper-body motor disabilities performing personalized ability-based gestures. For two conditions (user-dependent, gesture articulation variability), \$B outperformed our comparison algorithms (traditional machine learning with expert features and deep learning), with > 95% recognition rate. For the user-independent condition, \$B and deep learning performed comparably for participants with disabilities. Our biosignal dataset is publicly available online. $B highlights the potential and feasibility of accessible biosignal interfaces."
Local surrogate models with reduced dimensionality via overlapping domain decomposition and proper generalized decomposition,"We propose an efficient algorithm that combines overlapping domain decomposition and proper generalized decomposition (PGD) to construct surrogate models of linear elliptic parametric problems. The technique is composed of an offline and an online phase that can be implemented in a fully non-intrusive way. The online phase relies on a substructured algebraic formulation of the alternating Schwarz method, while the offline phase exploits the linearity of the boundary value problem to characterize a PGD basis and generate local surrogate models, with minimal parametric dimensionality, in each subdomain. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology."
Scores as Actions: a framework of fine-tuning diffusion models by continuous-time reinforcement learning,"Reinforcement Learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been shown a promising direction for aligning generative models with human intent and has also been explored in recent works for alignment of diffusion generative models. In this work, we provide a rigorous treatment by formulating the task of fine-tuning diffusion models, with reward functions learned from human feedback, as an exploratory continuous-time stochastic control problem. Our key idea lies in treating the score-matching functions as controls/actions, and upon this, we develop a unified framework from a continuous-time perspective, to employ reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in terms of improving the generation quality of diffusion models. We also develop the corresponding continuous-time RL theory for policy optimization and regularization under assumptions of stochastic different equations driven environment. Experiments on the text-to-image (T2I) generation will be reported in the accompanied paper."
360PanT: Training-Free Text-Driven 360-Degree Panorama-to-Panorama Translation,"Preserving boundary continuity in the translation of 360-degree panoramas remains a significant challenge for existing text-driven image-to-image translation methods. These methods often produce visually jarring discontinuities at the translated panorama's boundaries, disrupting the immersive experience. To address this issue, we propose 360PanT, a training-free approach to text-based 360-degree panorama-to-panorama translation with boundary continuity. Our 360PanT achieves seamless translations through two key components: boundary continuity encoding and seamless tiling translation with spatial control. Firstly, the boundary continuity encoding embeds critical boundary continuity information of the input 360-degree panorama into the noisy latent representation by constructing an extended input image. Secondly, leveraging this embedded noisy latent representation and guided by a target prompt, the seamless tiling translation with spatial control enables the generation of a translated image with identical left and right halves while adhering to the extended input's structure and semantic layout. This process ensures a final translated 360-degree panorama with seamless boundary continuity. Experimental results on both real-world and synthesized datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our 360PanT in translating 360-degree panoramas. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/littlewhitesea/360PanT}{https://github.com/littlewhitesea/360PanT}."
Federated One-Shot Ensemble Clustering,"Cluster analysis across multiple institutions poses significant challenges due to data-sharing restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Federated One-shot Ensemble Clustering (FONT) algorithm, a novel solution tailored for multi-site analyses under such constraints. FONT requires only a single round of communication between sites and ensures privacy by exchanging only fitted model parameters and class labels. The algorithm combines locally fitted clustering models into a data-adaptive ensemble, making it broadly applicable to various clustering techniques and robust to differences in cluster proportions across sites. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of the data-adaptive weights learned by FONT, and simulation studies demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmark methods. We applied FONT to identify subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis across two health systems, revealing improved consistency of patient clusters across sites, while locally fitted clusters proved less transferable. FONT is particularly well-suited for real-world applications with stringent communication and privacy constraints, offering a scalable and practical solution for multi-site clustering."
Graphical Structural Learning of rs-fMRI data in Heavy Smokers,"Recent studies revealed structural and functional brain changes in heavy smokers. However, the specific changes in topological brain connections are not well understood. We used Gaussian Undirected Graphs with the graphical lasso algorithm on rs-fMRI data from smokers and non-smokers to identify significant changes in brain connections. Our results indicate high stability in the estimated graphs and identify several brain regions significantly affected by smoking, providing valuable insights for future clinical research."
"Automated Cybersecurity Compliance and Threat Response Using AI, Blockchain & Smart Contracts","To address the challenges of internal security policy compliance and dynamic threat response in organizations, we present a novel framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and smart contracts. We propose a system that automates the enforcement of security policies, reducing manual effort and potential human error. Utilizing AI, we can analyse cyber threat intelligence rapidly, identify non-compliances and automatically adjust cyber defence mechanisms. Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for transparent logging of compliance actions, while smart contracts ensure uniform application of security measures. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations, showing improvements in compliance enforcement rates and response times compared to traditional methods. Ultimately, our approach provides for a scalable solution for managing complex security policies, reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency while achieving compliance. Finally, we discuss practical implications and propose future research directions to further refine the system and address implementation challenges."
Higher-Order Topological Directionality and Directed Simplicial Neural Networks,"Topological Deep Learning (TDL) has emerged as a paradigm to process and learn from signals defined on higher-order combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes. Although many complex systems have an asymmetric relational structure, most TDL models forcibly symmetrize these relationships. In this paper, we first introduce a novel notion of higher-order directionality and we then design Directed Simplicial Neural Networks (Dir-SNNs) based on it. Dir-SNNs are message-passing networks operating on directed simplicial complexes able to leverage directed and possibly asymmetric interactions among the simplices. To our knowledge, this is the first TDL model using a notion of higher-order directionality. We theoretically and empirically prove that Dir-SNNs are more expressive than their directed graph counterpart in distinguishing isomorphic directed graphs. Experiments on a synthetic source localization task demonstrate that Dir-SNNs outperform undirected SNNs when the underlying complex is directed, and perform comparably when the underlying complex is undirected."
Continual Learning in 3D Point Clouds: Employing Spectral Techniques for Exemplar Selection,"We introduce a novel framework for Continual Learning in 3D object classification (CL3D). Our approach is based on the selection of prototypes from each class using spectral clustering. For non-Euclidean data such as point clouds, spectral clustering can be employed as long as one can define a distance measure between pairs of samples. Choosing the appropriate distance measure enables us to leverage 3D geometric characteristics to identify representative prototypes for each class. We explore the effectiveness of clustering in the input space (3D points), local feature space (1024-dimensional points), and global feature space. We conduct experiments on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy exclusively through the use of input space features. By leveraging the combined input, local, and global features, we have improved the state-of-the-art on ModelNet and ShapeNet, utilizing nearly half the memory used by competing approaches. For the challenging ScanNet dataset, our method enhances accuracy by 4.1% while consuming just 28% of the memory used by our competitors, demonstrating the scalability of our approach."
Foundation of Calculating Normalized Maximum Likelihood for Continuous Probability Models,"The normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code length is widely used as a model selection criterion based on the minimum description length principle, where the model with the shortest NML code length is selected. A common method to calculate the NML code length is to use the sum (for a discrete model) or integral (for a continuous model) of a function defined by the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator. While this method has been proven to correctly calculate the NML code length of discrete models, no proof has been provided for continuous cases. Consequently, it has remained unclear whether the method can accurately calculate the NML code length of continuous models. In this paper, we solve this problem affirmatively, proving that the method is also correct for continuous cases. Remarkably, completing the proof for continuous cases is non-trivial in that it cannot be achieved by merely replacing the sums in discrete cases with integrals, as the decomposition trick applied to sums in the discrete model case proof is not applicable to integrals in the continuous model case proof. To overcome this, we introduce a novel decomposition approach based on the coarea formula from geometric measure theory, which is essential to establishing our proof for continuous cases."
Self-Supervised Inference of Agents in Trustless Environments,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach where agents can form swarms to produce high-quality responses effectively. This is accomplished by utilizing agents capable of data inference and ranking, which can be effectively implemented using LLMs as response classifiers. We assess existing approaches for trustless agent inference, define our methodology, estimate practical parameters, and model various types of malicious agent attacks. Our method leverages the collective intelligence of swarms, ensuring robust and efficient decentralized AI inference with better accuracy, security, and reliability. We show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than other trustless inference strategies reaching less than 125 ms validation latency."
Noisy Low Rank Column-wise Sensing,"This letter studies the AltGDmin algorithm for solving the noisy low rank column-wise sensing (LRCS) problem. Our sample complexity guarantee improves upon the best existing one by a factor $\max(r, \log(1/\epsilon))/r$ where $r$ is the rank of the unknown matrix and $\epsilon$ is the final desired accuracy. A second contribution of this work is a detailed comparison of guarantees from all work that studies the exact same mathematical problem as LRCS, but refers to it by different names."
Stochastic Reinforcement Learning with Stability Guarantees for Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems,"Designing a stabilizing controller for nonlinear systems is a challenging task, especially for high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms applied to stabilization tasks tend to drive the system close to the equilibrium point. However, these approaches often fall short of achieving true stabilization and result in persistent oscillations around the equilibrium point. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes the system by learning a local linear representation ofthe dynamics. The main component of the algorithm is integrating the learned gain matrix directly into the neural policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several challenging high-dimensional dynamical systems. In these simulations, our algorithm outperforms popular reinforcement learning algorithms, such as soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO), and successfully stabilizes the system. To support the numerical results, we provide a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of the learned algorithm for both deterministic and stochastic reinforcement learning settings, along with a convergence analysis of the proposed learning algorithm. Furthermore, we verify that the learned control policies indeed provide asymptotic stability for the nonlinear systems."
Rethinking Prompting Strategies for Multi-Label Recognition with Partial Annotations,"Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been adapted for Multi-Label Recognition (MLR) with partial annotations by leveraging prompt-learning, where positive and negative prompts are learned for each class to associate their embeddings with class presence or absence in the shared vision-text feature space. While this approach improves MLR performance by relying on VLM priors, we hypothesize that learning negative prompts may be suboptimal, as the datasets used to train VLMs lack image-caption pairs explicitly focusing on class absence. To analyze the impact of positive and negative prompt learning on MLR, we introduce PositiveCoOp and NegativeCoOp, where only one prompt is learned with VLM guidance while the other is replaced by an embedding vector learned directly in the shared feature space without relying on the text encoder. Through empirical analysis, we observe that negative prompts degrade MLR performance, and learning only positive prompts, combined with learned negative embeddings (PositiveCoOp), outperforms dual prompt learning approaches. Moreover, we quantify the performance benefits that prompt-learning offers over a simple vision-features-only baseline, observing that the baseline displays strong performance comparable to dual prompt learning approach (DualCoOp), when the proportion of missing labels is low, while requiring half the training compute and 16 times fewer parameters"
The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot,"Generative AI (GenAI) has been shown to enhance individual productivity in a guided setting. While it is also likely to transform processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of origination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration tasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. We study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime example of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and unguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October 2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for R. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that GenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions, which are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work, significantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly origination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was exacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns that, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between origination and iterative solutions may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions."
Learned Compression for Images and Point Clouds,"Over the last decade, deep learning has shown great success at performing computer vision tasks, including classification, super-resolution, and style transfer. Now, we apply it to data compression to help build the next generation of multimedia codecs. This thesis provides three primary contributions to this new field of learned compression. First, we present an efficient low-complexity entropy model that dynamically adapts the encoding distribution to a specific input by compressing and transmitting the encoding distribution itself as side information. Secondly, we propose a novel lightweight low-complexity point cloud codec that is highly specialized for classification, attaining significant reductions in bitrate compared to non-specialized codecs. Lastly, we explore how motion within the input domain between consecutive video frames is manifested in the corresponding convolutionally-derived latent space."
OpenACE: An Open Benchmark for Evaluating Audio Coding Performance,"Audio and speech coding lack unified evaluation and open-source testing. Many candidate systems were evaluated on proprietary, non-reproducible, or small data, and machine learning-based codecs are often tested on datasets with similar distributions as trained on, which is unfairly compared to digital signal processing-based codecs that usually work well with unseen data. This paper presents a full-band audio and speech coding quality benchmark with more variable content types, including traditional open test vectors. An example use case of audio coding quality assessment is presented with open-source Opus, 3GPP's EVS, and recent ETSI's LC3 with LC3+ used in Bluetooth LE Audio profiles. Besides, quality variations of emotional speech encoding at 16 kbps are shown. The proposed open-source benchmark contributes to audio and speech coding democratization and is available at https://github.com/JozefColdenhoff/OpenACE."
FedProphet: Memory-Efficient Federated Adversarial Training via Theoretic-Robustness and Low-Inconsistency Cascade Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) provides a strong privacy guarantee by enabling local training across edge devices without training data sharing, and Federated Adversarial Training (FAT) further enhances the robustness against adversarial examples, promoting a step toward trustworthy artificial intelligence. However, FAT requires a large model to preserve high accuracy while achieving strong robustness, and it is impractically slow when directly training with memory-constrained edge devices due to the memory-swapping latency. Moreover, existing memory-efficient FL methods suffer from poor accuracy and weak robustness in FAT because of inconsistent local and global models, i.e., objective inconsistency.   In this paper, we propose FedProphet, a novel FAT framework that can achieve memory efficiency, adversarial robustness, and objective consistency simultaneously. FedProphet partitions the large model into small cascaded modules such that the memory-constrained devices can conduct adversarial training module-by-module. A strong convexity regularization is derived to theoretically guarantee the robustness of the whole model, and we show that the strong robustness implies low objective inconsistency in FedProphet. We also develop a training coordinator on the server of FL, with Adaptive Perturbation Adjustment for utility-robustness balance and Differentiated Module Assignment for objective inconsistency mitigation. FedProphet empirically shows a significant improvement in both accuracy and robustness compared to previous memory-efficient methods, achieving almost the same performance of end-to-end FAT with 80% memory reduction and up to 10.8x speedup in training time."
Time-Varying Foot-Placement Control for Underactuated Humanoid Walking on Swaying Rigid Surfaces,"Locomotion on dynamic rigid surface (i.e., rigid surface accelerating in an inertial frame) presents complex challenges for controller design, which are essential for deploying humanoid robots in dynamic real-world environments such as moving trains, ships, and airplanes. This paper introduces a real-time, provably stabilizing control approach for underactuated humanoid walking on periodically swaying rigid surface. The first key contribution is the analytical extension of the classical angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model from static to swaying grounds. This extension results in a time-varying, nonhomogeneous robot model, which is fundamentally different from the existing pendulum models. We synthesize a discrete footstep control law for the model and derive a new set of sufficient stability conditions that verify the controller's stabilizing effect. Another key contribution is the development of a hierarchical control framework that incorporates the proposed footstep control law as its higher-layer planner to ensure the stability of underactuated walking. The closed-loop stability of the complete hybrid, full-order robot dynamics under this control framework is provably analyzed based on nonlinear control theory. Finally, experiments conducted on a Digit humanoid robot, both in simulations and with hardware, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in addressing underactuated bipedal locomotion on swaying ground, even in the presence of uncertain surface motions and unknown external pushes."
E-QUARTIC: Energy Efficient Edge Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource-Optimized Learning,"Ensemble learning is a meta-learning approach that combines the predictions of multiple learners, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness. Nevertheless, ensembling models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) result in high memory and computing overhead, preventing their deployment in embedded systems. These devices are usually equipped with small batteries that provide power supply and might include energy-harvesting modules that extract energy from the environment. In this work, we propose E-QUARTIC, a novel Energy Efficient Edge Ensembling framework to build ensembles of CNNs targeting Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based embedded systems. Our design outperforms single-instance CNN baselines and state-of-the-art edge AI solutions, improving accuracy and adapting to varying energy conditions while maintaining similar memory requirements. Then, we leverage the multi-CNN structure of the designed ensemble to implement an energy-aware model selection policy in energy-harvesting AI systems. We show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art by reducing system failure rate by up to 40% while ensuring higher average output qualities. Ultimately, we show that the proposed design enables concurrent on-device training and high-quality inference execution at the edge, limiting the performance and energy overheads to less than 0.04%."
LightSABRE: A Lightweight and Enhanced SABRE Algorithm,"We introduce LightSABRE, a significant enhancement of the SABRE algorithm that advances both runtime efficiency and circuit quality. LightSABRE addresses the increasing demands of modern quantum hardware, which can now accommodate complex scenarios, and circuits with millions of gates. Through iterative development within Qiskit, primarily using the Rust programming language, we have achieved a version of the algorithm in Qiskit 1.2.0 that is approximately 200 times faster than the implementation in Qiskit 0.20.1, which already introduced key improvements like the release valve mechanism. Additionally, when compared to the SABRE algorithm presented in Li et al., LightSABRE delivers an average decrease of 18.9\% in SWAP gate count across the same benchmark circuits. Unlike SABRE, which struggles with scalability and convergence on large circuits, LightSABRE delivers consistently high-quality routing solutions, enabling the efficient execution of large quantum circuits on near-term and future quantum devices. LightSABRE's improvements in speed, scalability, and quality position it as a critical tool for optimizing quantum circuits in the context of evolving quantum hardware and error correction techniques."
Compression with wildcards: All induced metric subgraphs,"Driven by applications in the natural, social and computer sciences several algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all sets $X$ of vertices of a graph $G$ that induce a connected subgraph. Our algorithm AllMetricSets enumerates all $X$'s that induce (more exquisite) metric subgraphs. Here ""metric"" means that any distinct $s,t\in X$ are joined by a globally shortest $s-t$ path."
Deep Ritz -- Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements,"While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented."
"The Informal Labor of Content Creators: Situating Xiaohongshu's Key Opinion Consumers in Relationships to Marketers, Consumer Brands, and the Platform","This paper critically examines flexible content creation conducted by Key Opinion Consumers (KOCs) on a prominent social media and e-commerce platform in China, Xiaohongshu (RED). Drawing on nine-month ethnographic work conducted online, we find that the production of the KOC role on RED is predicated on the interactions and negotiations among multiple stakeholders -- content creators, marketers, consumer brands (corporations), and the platform. KOCs are instrumental in RED influencer marketing tactics and amplify the mundane and daily life content popular on the platform. They navigate the dynamics in the triangulated relations with other stakeholders in order to secure economic opportunities for producing advertorial content, and yet, the labor involved in producing such content is deliberately obscured to make it appear as spontaneous, ordinary user posts for the sake of marketing campaigns. Meanwhile, the commercial value of their work is often underestimated and overshadowed in corporate paperwork, platform technological mechanisms, and business models, resulting in and reinforcing inadequate recognition and compensation of KOCs. We propose the concept of ``informal labor'' to offer a new lens to understand content creation labor that is indispensable yet unrecognized by the social media industry. We advocate for a contextualized and nuanced examination of how labor is valued and compensated and urge for better protections and working conditions for informal laborers like KOCs."
An Experimental Study of Competitive Market Behavior Through LLMs,"This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to conduct market experiments, aiming to understand their capability to comprehend competitive market dynamics. We model the behavior of market agents in a controlled experimental setting, assessing their ability to converge toward competitive equilibria. The results reveal the challenges current LLMs face in replicating the dynamic decision-making processes characteristic of human trading behavior. Unlike humans, LLMs lacked the capacity to achieve market equilibrium. The research demonstrates that while LLMs provide a valuable tool for scalable and reproducible market simulations, their current limitations necessitate further advancements to fully capture the complexities of market behavior. Future work that enhances dynamic learning capabilities and incorporates elements of behavioral economics could improve the effectiveness of LLMs in the economic domain, providing new insights into market dynamics and aiding in the refinement of economic policies."
COMEX Copper Futures Volatility Forecasting: Econometric Models and Deep Learning,"This paper investigates the forecasting performance of COMEX copper futures realized volatility across various high-frequency intervals using both econometric volatility models and deep learning recurrent neural network models. The econometric models considered are GARCH and HAR, while the deep learning models include RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). In forecasting daily realized volatility for COMEX copper futures with a rolling window approach, the econometric models, particularly HAR, outperform recurrent neural networks overall, with HAR achieving the lowest QLIKE loss function value. However, when the data is replaced with hourly high-frequency realized volatility, the deep learning models outperform the GARCH model, and HAR attains a comparable QLIKE loss function value. Despite the black-box nature of machine learning models, the deep learning models demonstrate superior forecasting performance, surpassing the fixed QLIKE value of HAR in the experiment. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends for daily realized volatility, deep learning models gradually close the performance gap with the GARCH model in certain loss function metrics. Nonetheless, HAR remains the most effective model overall for daily realized volatility forecasting in copper futures."
Robust Dual Gaussian Splatting for Immersive Human-centric Volumetric Videos,"Volumetric video represents a transformative advancement in visual media, enabling users to freely navigate immersive virtual experiences and narrowing the gap between digital and real worlds. However, the need for extensive manual intervention to stabilize mesh sequences and the generation of excessively large assets in existing workflows impedes broader adoption. In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian-based approach, dubbed \textit{DualGS}, for real-time and high-fidelity playback of complex human performance with excellent compression ratios. Our key idea in DualGS is to separately represent motion and appearance using the corresponding skin and joint Gaussians. Such an explicit disentanglement can significantly reduce motion redundancy and enhance temporal coherence. We begin by initializing the DualGS and anchoring skin Gaussians to joint Gaussians at the first frame. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine training strategy for frame-by-frame human performance modeling. It includes a coarse alignment phase for overall motion prediction as well as a fine-grained optimization for robust tracking and high-fidelity rendering. To integrate volumetric video seamlessly into VR environments, we efficiently compress motion using entropy encoding and appearance using codec compression coupled with a persistent codebook. Our approach achieves a compression ratio of up to 120 times, only requiring approximately 350KB of storage per frame. We demonstrate the efficacy of our representation through photo-realistic, free-view experiences on VR headsets, enabling users to immersively watch musicians in performance and feel the rhythm of the notes at the performers' fingertips."
Bayesian Inverse Graphics for Few-Shot Concept Learning,"Humans excel at building generalizations of new concepts from just one single example. Contrary to this, current computer vision models typically require large amount of training samples to achieve a comparable accuracy. In this work we present a Bayesian model of perception that learns using only minimal data, a prototypical probabilistic program of an object. Specifically, we propose a generative inverse graphics model of primitive shapes, to infer posterior distributions over physically consistent parameters from one or several images. We show how this representation can be used for downstream tasks such as few-shot classification and pose estimation. Our model outperforms existing few-shot neural-only classification algorithms and demonstrates generalization across varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and out-of-distribution shapes. By design, our model is uncertainty-aware and uses our new differentiable renderer for optimizing global scene parameters through gradient descent, sampling posterior distributions over object parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and using a neural based likelihood function."
An efficient heuristic for approximate maximum flow computations,"Several concepts borrowed from graph theory are routinely used to better understand the inner workings of the (human) brain. To this end, a connectivity network of the brain is built first, which then allows one to assess quantities such as information flow and information routing via shortest path and maximum flow computations. Since brain networks typically contain several thousand nodes and edges, computational scaling is a key research area. In this contribution, we focus on approximate maximum flow computations in large brain networks. By combining graph partitioning with maximum flow computations, we propose a new approximation algorithm for the computation of the maximum flow with runtime O(|V||E|^2/k^2) compared to the usual runtime of O(|V||E|^2) for the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges, and $k$ is the number of partitions. We assess both accuracy and runtime of the proposed algorithm on simulated graphs as well as on graphs downloaded from the Brain Networks Data Repository (https://networkrepository.com)."
Scientific and technological knowledge grows linearly over time,"The past few centuries have witnessed a dramatic growth in scientific and technological knowledge. However, the nature of that growth - whether exponential or otherwise - remains controversial, perhaps partly due to the lack of quantitative characterizations. We evaluated knowledge as a collective thinking structure, using citation networks as a representation, by examining extensive datasets that include 213 million publications (1800-2020) and 7.6 million patents (1976-2020). We found that knowledge - which we conceptualize as the reduction of uncertainty in a knowledge network - grew linearly over time in naturally formed citation networks that themselves expanded exponentially. Moreover, our results revealed inflection points in the growth of knowledge that often corresponded to important developments within fields, such as major breakthroughs, new paradigms, or the emergence of entirely new areas of study. Around these inflection points, knowledge may grow rapidly or exponentially on a local scale, although the overall growth rate remains linear when viewed globally. Previous studies concluding an exponential growth of knowledge may have focused primarily on these local bursts of rapid growth around key developments, leading to the misconception of a global exponential trend. Our findings help to reconcile the discrepancy between the perceived exponential growth and the actual linear growth of knowledge by highlighting the distinction between local and global growth patterns. Overall, our findings reveal major science development trends for policymaking, showing that producing knowledge is far more challenging than producing papers."
Towards Quantifying and Reducing Language Mismatch Effects in Cross-Lingual Speech Anti-Spoofing,"The effects of language mismatch impact speech anti-spoofing systems, while investigations and quantification of these effects remain limited. Existing anti-spoofing datasets are mainly in English, and the high cost of acquiring multilingual datasets hinders training language-independent models. We initiate this work by evaluating top-performing speech anti-spoofing systems that are trained on English data but tested on other languages, observing notable performance declines. We propose an innovative approach - Accent-based data expansion via TTS (ACCENT), which introduces diverse linguistic knowledge to monolingual-trained models, improving their cross-lingual capabilities. We conduct experiments on a large-scale dataset consisting of over 3 million samples, including 1.8 million training samples and nearly 1.2 million testing samples across 12 languages. The language mismatch effects are preliminarily quantified and remarkably reduced over 15% by applying the proposed ACCENT. This easily implementable method shows promise for multilingual and low-resource language scenarios."
SIG: A Synthetic Identity Generation Pipeline for Generating Evaluation Datasets for Face Recognition,"As Artificial Intelligence applications expand, the evaluation of models faces heightened scrutiny. Ensuring public readiness requires evaluation datasets, which differ from training data by being disjoint and ethically sourced in compliance with privacy regulations. The performance and fairness of face recognition systems depend significantly on the quality and representativeness of these evaluation datasets. This data is sometimes scraped from the internet without user's consent, causing ethical concerns that can prohibit its use without proper releases. In rare cases, data is collected in a controlled environment with consent, however, this process is time-consuming, expensive, and logistically difficult to execute. This creates a barrier for those unable to conjure the immense resources required to gather ethically sourced evaluation datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synthetic Identity Generation pipeline, or SIG, that allows for the targeted creation of ethical, balanced datasets for face recognition evaluation. Our proposed and demonstrated pipeline generates high-quality images of synthetic identities with controllable pose, facial features, and demographic attributes, such as race, gender, and age. We also release an open-source evaluation dataset named ControlFace10k, consisting of 10,008 face images of 3,336 unique synthetic identities balanced across race, gender, and age, generated using the proposed SIG pipeline. We analyze ControlFace10k along with a non-synthetic BUPT dataset using state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness as an evaluation tool. This analysis highlights the dataset's characteristics and its utility in assessing algorithmic bias across different demographic groups."
Undecidability and incompleteness in quantum information theory and operator algebras,"We survey a number of incompleteness results in operator algebras stemming from the recent undecidability result in quantum complexity theory known as $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$, the most prominent of which is the G\""odelian refutation of the Connes Embedding Problem. We also discuss the very recent use of $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$ in refuting the Aldous-Lyons conjecture in probability theory."
X-ray Fluoroscopy Guided Localization and Steering of Medical Microrobots through Virtual Enhancement,"In developing medical interventions using untethered milli- and microrobots, ensuring safety and effectiveness relies on robust methods for detection, real-time tracking, and precise localization within the body. However, the inherent non-transparency of the human body poses a significant obstacle, limiting robot detection primarily to specialized imaging systems such as X-ray fluoroscopy, which often lack crucial anatomical details. Consequently, the robot operator (human or machine) would encounter severe challenges in accurately determining the location of the robot and steering its motion. This study explores the feasibility of circumventing this challenge by creating a simulation environment that contains the precise digital replica (virtual twin) of a model microrobot operational workspace. Synchronizing coordinate systems between the virtual and real worlds and continuously integrating microrobot position data from the image stream into the virtual twin allows the microrobot operator to control navigation in the virtual world. We validate this concept by demonstrating the tracking and steering of a mobile magnetic robot in confined phantoms with high temporal resolution (< 100 ms, with an average of ~20 ms) visual feedback. Additionally, our object detection-based localization approach offers the potential to reduce overall patient exposure to X-ray doses during continuous microrobot tracking without compromising tracking accuracy. Ultimately, we address a critical gap in developing image-guided remote interventions with untethered medical microrobots, particularly for near-future applications in animal models and human patients."
Simplicial maps between spheres and Davis' manifolds with positive simplicial volume,"We study the simplicial volume of manifolds obtained from Davis' reflection group trick, the goal being characterizing those having positive simplicial volume. In particular, we focus on checking whether manifolds in this class with nonzero Euler characteristic have positive simplicial volume (Gromov asked whether this holds in general for aspherical manifolds). This leads to a combinatorial problem about triangulations of spheres: we define a partial order on the set of triangulations -- the relation being the existence of a nonzero-degree simplicial map between two triangulations -- and the problem is to find the minimal elements of a specific subposet. We solve explicitly the case of triangulations of the two-dimensional sphere, and then perform an extensive analysis, with the help of computer searches, of the three-dimensional case. Moreover, we present a connection of this problem with the theory of graph minors."
Mixed precision iterative refinement for linear inverse problems,"This study investigates the iterative refinement method applied to the solution of linear discrete inverse problems by considering its application to the Tikhonov problem in mixed precision. Previous works on mixed precision iterative refinement methods for the solution of symmetric positive definite linear systems and least-squares problems have shown regularization to be a key requirement when computing low precision factorizations. For problems that are naturally severely ill-posed, we formulate the iterates of iterative refinement in mixed precision as a filtered solution using the preconditioned Landweber method with a Tikhonov-type preconditioner. Through numerical examples simulating various mixed precision choices, we showcase the filtering properties of the method and the achievement of comparable or superior accuracy compared to results computed in double precision as well as another approximate method."
Digital Volumetric Biopsy Cores Improve Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer Using Deep Learning,"Prostate cancer (PCa) was the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American men in 2023. The histological grading of biopsies is essential for diagnosis, and various deep learning-based solutions have been developed to assist with this task. Existing deep learning frameworks are typically applied to individual 2D cross-sections sliced from 3D biopsy tissue specimens. This process impedes the analysis of complex tissue structures such as glands, which can vary depending on the tissue slice examined. We propose a novel digital pathology data source called a ""volumetric core,"" obtained via the extraction and co-alignment of serially sectioned tissue sections using a novel morphology-preserving alignment framework. We trained an attention-based multiple-instance learning (ABMIL) framework on deep features extracted from volumetric patches to automatically classify the Gleason Grade Group (GGG). To handle volumetric patches, we used a modified video transformer with a deep feature extractor pretrained using self-supervised learning. We ran our morphology-preserving alignment framework to construct 10,210 volumetric cores, leaving out 30% for pretraining. The rest of the dataset was used to train ABMIL, which resulted in a 0.958 macro-average AUC, 0.671 F1 score, 0.661 precision, and 0.695 recall averaged across all five GGG significantly outperforming the 2D baselines."
Real or Robotic? Assessing Whether LLMs Accurately Simulate Qualities of Human Responses in Dialogue,"Studying and building datasets for dialogue tasks is both expensive and time-consuming due to the need to recruit, train, and collect data from study participants. In response, much recent work has sought to use large language models (LLMs) to simulate both human-human and human-LLM interactions, as they have been shown to generate convincingly human-like text in many settings. However, to what extent do LLM-based simulations \textit{actually} reflect human dialogues? In this work, we answer this question by generating a large-scale dataset of 100,000 paired LLM-LLM and human-LLM dialogues from the WildChat dataset and quantifying how well the LLM simulations align with their human counterparts. Overall, we find relatively low alignment between simulations and human interactions, demonstrating a systematic divergence along the multiple textual properties, including style and content. Further, in comparisons of English, Chinese, and Russian dialogues, we find that models perform similarly. Our results suggest that LLMs generally perform better when the human themself writes in a way that is more similar to the LLM's own style."
DreamHOI: Subject-Driven Generation of 3D Human-Object Interactions with Diffusion Priors,"We present DreamHOI, a novel method for zero-shot synthesis of human-object interactions (HOIs), enabling a 3D human model to realistically interact with any given object based on a textual description. This task is complicated by the varying categories and geometries of real-world objects and the scarcity of datasets encompassing diverse HOIs. To circumvent the need for extensive data, we leverage text-to-image diffusion models trained on billions of image-caption pairs. We optimize the articulation of a skinned human mesh using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) gradients obtained from these models, which predict image-space edits. However, directly backpropagating image-space gradients into complex articulation parameters is ineffective due to the local nature of such gradients. To overcome this, we introduce a dual implicit-explicit representation of a skinned mesh, combining (implicit) neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with (explicit) skeleton-driven mesh articulation. During optimization, we transition between implicit and explicit forms, grounding the NeRF generation while refining the mesh articulation. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating realistic HOIs."
Depth on Demand: Streaming Dense Depth from a Low Frame Rate Active Sensor,"High frame rate and accurate depth estimation plays an important role in several tasks crucial to robotics and automotive perception. To date, this can be achieved through ToF and LiDAR devices for indoor and outdoor applications, respectively. However, their applicability is limited by low frame rate, energy consumption, and spatial sparsity. Depth on Demand (DoD) allows for accurate temporal and spatial depth densification achieved by exploiting a high frame rate RGB sensor coupled with a potentially lower frame rate and sparse active depth sensor. Our proposal jointly enables lower energy consumption and denser shape reconstruction, by significantly reducing the streaming requirements on the depth sensor thanks to its three core stages: i) multi-modal encoding, ii) iterative multi-modal integration, and iii) depth decoding. We present extended evidence assessing the effectiveness of DoD on indoor and outdoor video datasets, covering both environment scanning and automotive perception use cases."
AnySkin: Plug-and-play Skin Sensing for Robotic Touch,"While tactile sensing is widely accepted as an important and useful sensing modality, its use pales in comparison to other sensory modalities like vision and proprioception. AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede the use of tactile sensing -- versatility, replaceability, and data reusability. Building on the simplistic design of ReSkin, and decoupling the sensing electronics from the sensing interface, AnySkin simplifies integration making it as straightforward as putting on a phone case and connecting a charger. Furthermore, AnySkin is the first uncalibrated tactile-sensor with cross-instance generalizability of learned manipulation policies. To summarize, this work makes three key contributions: first, we introduce a streamlined fabrication process and a design tool for creating an adhesive-free, durable and easily replaceable magnetic tactile sensor; second, we characterize slip detection and policy learning with the AnySkin sensor; and third, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization of models trained on one instance of AnySkin to new instances, and compare it with popular existing tactile solutions like DIGIT and ReSkin.https://any-skin.github.io/"
DeCLIP: Decoding CLIP representations for deepfake localization,"Generative models can create entirely new images, but they can also partially modify real images in ways that are undetectable to the human eye. In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically detecting such local manipulations. One of the most pressing problems in deepfake detection remains the ability of models to generalize to different classes of generators. In the case of fully manipulated images, representations extracted from large self-supervised models (such as CLIP) provide a promising direction towards more robust detectors. Here, we introduce DeCLIP, a first attempt to leverage such large pretrained features for detecting local manipulations. We show that, when combined with a reasonably large convolutional decoder, pretrained self-supervised representations are able to perform localization and improve generalization capabilities over existing methods. Unlike previous work, our approach is able to perform localization on the challenging case of latent diffusion models, where the entire image is affected by the fingerprint of the generator. Moreover, we observe that this type of data, which combines local semantic information with a global fingerprint, provides more stable generalization than other categories of generative methods."
Hand-Object Interaction Pretraining from Videos,"We present an approach to learn general robot manipulation priors from 3D hand-object interaction trajectories. We build a framework to use in-the-wild videos to generate sensorimotor robot trajectories. We do so by lifting both the human hand and the manipulated object in a shared 3D space and retargeting human motions to robot actions. Generative modeling on this data gives us a task-agnostic base policy. This policy captures a general yet flexible manipulation prior. We empirically demonstrate that finetuning this policy, with both reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC), enables sample-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks and simultaneously improves robustness and generalizability compared to prior approaches. Qualitative experiments are available at: \url{https://hgaurav2k.github.io/hop/}."
Click2Mask: Local Editing with Dynamic Mask Generation,"Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized image generation and editing, making these tasks accessible to non-experts. This paper focuses on local image editing, particularly the task of adding new content to a loosely specified area. Existing methods often require a precise mask or a detailed description of the location, which can be cumbersome and prone to errors. We propose Click2Mask, a novel approach that simplifies the local editing process by requiring only a single point of reference (in addition to the content description). A mask is dynamically grown around this point during a Blended Latent Diffusion (BLD) process, guided by a masked CLIP-based semantic loss. Click2Mask surpasses the limitations of segmentation-based and fine-tuning dependent methods, offering a more user-friendly and contextually accurate solution. Our experiments demonstrate that Click2Mask not only minimizes user effort but also delivers competitive or superior local image manipulation results compared to SoTA methods, according to both human judgement and automatic metrics. Key contributions include the simplification of user input, the ability to freely add objects unconstrained by existing segments, and the integration potential of our dynamic mask approach within other editing methods."
DreamBeast: Distilling 3D Fantastical Animals with Part-Aware Knowledge Transfer,"We present DreamBeast, a novel method based on score distillation sampling (SDS) for generating fantastical 3D animal assets composed of distinct parts. Existing SDS methods often struggle with this generation task due to a limited understanding of part-level semantics in text-to-image diffusion models. While recent diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion 3, demonstrate a better part-level understanding, they are prohibitively slow and exhibit other common problems associated with single-view diffusion models. DreamBeast overcomes this limitation through a novel part-aware knowledge transfer mechanism. For each generated asset, we efficiently extract part-level knowledge from the Stable Diffusion 3 model into a 3D Part-Affinity implicit representation. This enables us to instantly generate Part-Affinity maps from arbitrary camera views, which we then use to modulate the guidance of a multi-view diffusion model during SDS to create 3D assets of fantastical animals. DreamBeast significantly enhances the quality of generated 3D creatures with user-specified part compositions while reducing computational overhead, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations."
FlashSplat: 2D to 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation Solved Optimally,"This study addresses the challenge of accurately segmenting 3D Gaussian Splatting from 2D masks. Conventional methods often rely on iterative gradient descent to assign each Gaussian a unique label, leading to lengthy optimization and sub-optimal solutions. Instead, we propose a straightforward yet globally optimal solver for 3D-GS segmentation. The core insight of our method is that, with a reconstructed 3D-GS scene, the rendering of the 2D masks is essentially a linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian. As such, the optimal label assignment can be solved via linear programming in closed form. This solution capitalizes on the alpha blending characteristic of the splatting process for single step optimization. By incorporating the background bias in our objective function, our method shows superior robustness in 3D segmentation against noises. Remarkably, our optimization completes within 30 seconds, about 50$\times$ faster than the best existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method in segmenting various scenes, and its superior performance in downstream tasks such as object removal and inpainting. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/FlashSplat."
Touch2Touch: Cross-Modal Tactile Generation for Object Manipulation,"Today's touch sensors come in many shapes and sizes. This has made it challenging to develop general-purpose touch processing methods since models are generally tied to one specific sensor design. We address this problem by performing cross-modal prediction between touch sensors: given the tactile signal from one sensor, we use a generative model to estimate how the same physical contact would be perceived by another sensor. This allows us to apply sensor-specific methods to the generated signal. We implement this idea by training a diffusion model to translate between the popular GelSlim and Soft Bubble sensors. As a downstream task, we perform in-hand object pose estimation using GelSlim sensors while using an algorithm that operates only on Soft Bubble signals. The dataset, the code, and additional details can be found at https://www.mmintlab.com/research/touch2touch/."
CROSS: A Contributor-Project Interaction Lifecycle Model for Open Source Software,"Despite the widespread adoption of open source software (OSS), its sustainability remains a critical concern, particularly in light of security vulnerabilities and the often inadequate end-of-service (EoS) processes for OSS projects as they decline. Existing models of OSS community participation, like the Onion model and the episodic contribution model, offer valuable insights but are fundamentally incompatible and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of contributor engagement with OSS projects. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing the CROSS model, a novel contributor-project interaction lifecycle model for open source, which delineates the various lifecycle stages of contributor-project interaction along with the driving and retaining forces pertinent to each stage. By synthesizing existing research on OSS communities, organizational behavior, and human resource development, it explains a range of archetypal cases of contributor engagement and highlights research gaps, especially in EoS/offboarding scenarios. The CROSS model provides a foundation for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of OSS projects, offering a robust foundation for future research and practical application."
Windows Agent Arena: Evaluating Multi-Modal OS Agents at Scale,"Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning. However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage. Our benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes. To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we also introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi. Our agent achieves a success rate of 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted human. Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based benchmark, Mind2Web. We offer extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of Navi's performance, and provide insights into the opportunities for future research in agent development and data generation using Windows Agent Arena.

Learning incomplete factorization preconditioners for GMRES,"In this paper, we develop a data-driven approach to generate incomplete LU factorizations of large-scale sparse matrices. The learned approximate factorization is utilized as a preconditioner for the corresponding linear equation system in the GMRES method. Incomplete factorization methods are one of the most commonly applied algebraic preconditioners for sparse linear equation systems and are able to speed up the convergence of Krylov subspace methods. However, they are sensitive to hyper-parameters and might suffer from numerical breakdown or lead to slow convergence when not properly applied. We replace the typically hand-engineered algorithms with a graph neural network based approach that is trained against data to predict an approximate factorization. This allows us to learn preconditioners tailored for a specific problem distribution. We analyze and empirically evaluate different loss functions to train the learned preconditioners and show their effectiveness to decrease the number of GMRES iterations and improve the spectral properties on our synthetic dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/paulhausner/neural-incomplete-factorization."
Improving Text-guided Object Inpainting with Semantic Pre-inpainting,"Recent years have witnessed the success of large text-to-image diffusion models and their remarkable potential to generate high-quality images. The further pursuit of enhancing the editability of images has sparked significant interest in the downstream task of inpainting a novel object described by a text prompt within a designated region in the image. Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial from two aspects: 1) Solely relying on one single U-Net to align text prompt and visual object across all the denoising timesteps is insufficient to generate desired objects; 2) The controllability of object generation is not guaranteed in the intricate sampling space of diffusion model. In this paper, we propose to decompose the typical single-stage object inpainting into two cascaded processes: 1) semantic pre-inpainting that infers the semantic features of desired objects in a multi-modal feature space; 2) high-fieldity object generation in diffusion latent space that pivots on such inpainted semantic features. To achieve this, we cascade a Transformer-based semantic inpainter and an object inpainting diffusion model, leading to a novel CAscaded Transformer-Diffusion (CAT-Diffusion) framework for text-guided object inpainting. Technically, the semantic inpainter is trained to predict the semantic features of the target object conditioning on unmasked context and text prompt. The outputs of the semantic inpainter then act as the informative visual prompts to guide high-fieldity object generation through a reference adapter layer, leading to controllable object inpainting. Extensive evaluations on OpenImages-V6 and MSCOCO validate the superiority of CAT-Diffusion against the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Nnn-s/CATdiffusion}."
Improving Virtual Try-On with Garment-focused Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have led to the revolutionizing of generative modeling in numerous image synthesis tasks. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to directly apply diffusion models for synthesizing an image of a target person wearing a given in-shop garment, i.e., image-based virtual try-on (VTON) task. The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process should not only produce holistically high-fidelity photorealistic image of the target person, but also locally preserve every appearance and texture detail of the given garment. To address this, we shape a new Diffusion model, namely GarDiff, which triggers the garment-focused diffusion process with amplified guidance of both basic visual appearance and detailed textures (i.e., high-frequency details) derived from the given garment. GarDiff first remoulds a pre-trained latent diffusion model with additional appearance priors derived from the CLIP and VAE encodings of the reference garment. Meanwhile, a novel garment-focused adapter is integrated into the UNet of diffusion model, pursuing local fine-grained alignment with the visual appearance of reference garment and human pose. We specifically design an appearance loss over the synthesized garment to enhance the crucial, high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GarDiff when compared to state-of-the-art VTON approaches. Code is publicly available at: \href{https://github.com/siqi0905/GarDiff/tree/master}{https://github.com/siqi0905/GarDiff/tree/master}."
LoRID: Low-Rank Iterative Diffusion for Adversarial Purification,"This work presents an information-theoretic examination of diffusion-based purification methods, the state-of-the-art adversarial defenses that utilize diffusion models to remove malicious perturbations in adversarial examples. By theoretically characterizing the inherent purification errors associated with the Markov-based diffusion purifications, we introduce LoRID, a novel Low-Rank Iterative Diffusion purification method designed to remove adversarial perturbation with low intrinsic purification errors. LoRID centers around a multi-stage purification process that leverages multiple rounds of diffusion-denoising loops at the early time-steps of the diffusion models, and the integration of Tucker decomposition, an extension of matrix factorization, to remove adversarial noise at high-noise regimes. Consequently, LoRID increases the effective diffusion time-steps and overcomes strong adversarial attacks, achieving superior robustness performance in CIFAR-10/100, CelebA-HQ, and ImageNet datasets under both white-box and black-box settings."
The Design of Informative Take-Over Requests for Semi-Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems: Combining Spoken Language and Visual Icons in a Drone-Controller Setting,"The question of how cyber-physical systems should interact with human partners that can take over control or exert oversight is becoming more pressing, as these systems are deployed for an ever larger range of tasks. Drawing on the literatures on handing over control during semi-autonomous driving and human-robot interaction, we propose a design of a take-over request that combines an abstract pre-alert with an informative TOR: Relevant sensor information is highlighted on the controller's display, while a spoken message verbalizes the reason for the TOR. We conduct our study in the context of a semi-autonomous drone control scenario as our testbed. The goal of our online study is to assess in more detail what form a language-based TOR should take. Specifically, we compare a full sentence condition to shorter fragments, and test whether the visual highlighting should be done synchronously or asynchronously with the speech. Participants showed a higher accuracy in choosing the correct solution with our bi-modal TOR and felt that they were better able to recognize the critical situation. Using only fragments in the spoken message rather than full sentences did not lead to improved accuracy or faster reactions. Also, synchronizing the visual highlighting with the spoken message did not result in better accuracy and response times were even increased in this condition."
Dynamic Prompting of Frozen Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Panoptic Narrative Grounding,"Panoptic narrative grounding (PNG), whose core target is fine-grained image-text alignment, requires a panoptic segmentation of referred objects given a narrative caption. Previous discriminative methods achieve only weak or coarse-grained alignment by panoptic segmentation pretraining or CLIP model adaptation. Given the recent progress of text-to-image Diffusion models, several works have shown their capability to achieve fine-grained image-text alignment through cross-attention maps and improved general segmentation performance. However, the direct use of phrase features as static prompts to apply frozen Diffusion models to the PNG task still suffers from a large task gap and insufficient vision-language interaction, yielding inferior performance. Therefore, we propose an Extractive-Injective Phrase Adapter (EIPA) bypass within the Diffusion UNet to dynamically update phrase prompts with image features and inject the multimodal cues back, which leverages the fine-grained image-text alignment capability of Diffusion models more sufficiently. In addition, we also design a Multi-Level Mutual Aggregation (MLMA) module to reciprocally fuse multi-level image and phrase features for segmentation refinement. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance."
OmniQuery: Contextually Augmenting Captured Multimodal Memory to Enable Personal Question Answering,"People often capture memories through photos, screenshots, and videos. While existing AI-based tools enable querying this data using natural language, they mostly only support retrieving individual pieces of information like certain objects in photos and struggle with answering more complex queries that involve interpreting interconnected memories like event sequences. We conducted a one-month diary study to collect realistic user queries and generated a taxonomy of necessary contextual information for integrating with captured memories. We then introduce OmniQuery, a novel system that is able to answer complex personal memory-related questions that require extracting and inferring contextual information. OmniQuery augments single captured memories through integrating scattered contextual information from multiple interconnected memories, retrieves relevant memories, and uses a large language model (LLM) to comprehensive answers. In human evaluations, we show the effectiveness of OmniQuery with an accuracy of 71.5%, and it outperformed a conventional RAG system, winning or tying in 74.5% of the time."
Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Dynamics Uncertainty via Local Conformal Calibration,"Whether learned, simulated, or analytical, approximations of a robot's dynamics can be inaccurate when encountering novel environments. Many approaches have been proposed to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of such methods, i.e. uncertainty resulting from stochasticity, however these estimates alone are not enough to properly estimate the uncertainty of a model in a novel environment, where the actual dynamics can change. Such changes can induce epistemic uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty due to a lack of information/data. Accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric dynamics uncertainty in a theoretically-grounded way remains an open problem. We introduce Local Uncertainty Conformal Calibration (LUCCa), a conformal prediction-based approach that calibrates the aleatoric uncertainty estimates provided by dynamics models to generate probabilistically-valid prediction regions of the system's state. We account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty non-asymptotically, without strong assumptions about the form of the true dynamics or how it changes. The calibration is performed locally in the state-action space, leading to uncertainty estimates that are useful for planning. We validate our method by constructing probabilistically-safe plans for a double-integrator under significant changes in dynamics."
TextBoost: Towards One-Shot Personalization of Text-to-Image Models via Fine-tuning Text Encoder,"Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image models have opened up promising research avenues in personalized image generation, enabling users to create diverse images of a specific subject using natural language prompts. However, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation when given only a single reference image. They tend to overfit the input, producing highly similar outputs regardless of the text prompt. This paper addresses the challenge of one-shot personalization by mitigating overfitting, enabling the creation of controllable images through text prompts. Specifically, we propose a selective fine-tuning strategy that focuses on the text encoder. Furthermore, we introduce three key techniques to enhance personalization performance: (1) augmentation tokens to encourage feature disentanglement and alleviate overfitting, (2) a knowledge-preservation loss to reduce language drift and promote generalizability across diverse prompts, and (3) SNR-weighted sampling for efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently generates high-quality, diverse images using only a single reference image while significantly reducing memory and storage requirements."
Style Based Clustering of Visual Artworks,"Clustering artworks based on style has many potential real-world applications like art recommendations, style-based search and retrieval, and the study of artistic style evolution in an artwork corpus. However, clustering artworks based on style is largely an unaddressed problem. A few present methods for clustering artworks principally rely on generic image feature representations derived from deep neural networks and do not specifically deal with the artistic style. In this paper, we introduce and deliberate over the notion of style-based clustering of visual artworks. Our main objective is to explore neural feature representations and architectures that can be used for style-based clustering and observe their impact and effectiveness. We develop different methods and assess their relative efficacy for style-based clustering through qualitative and quantitative analysis by applying them to four artwork corpora and four curated synthetically styled datasets. Our analysis provides some key novel insights on architectures, feature representations, and evaluation methods suitable for style-based clustering."
Reasoning Around Paradox with Grounded Deduction,"How can we reason around logical paradoxes without falling into them? This paper introduces grounded deduction or GD, a Kripke-inspired approach to first-order logic and arithmetic that is neither classical nor intuitionistic, but nevertheless appears both pragmatically usable and intuitively justifiable. GD permits the direct expression of unrestricted recursive definitions - including paradoxical ones such as 'L := not L' - while adding dynamic typing premises to certain inference rules so that such paradoxes do not lead to inconsistency. This paper constitutes a preliminary development and investigation of grounded deduction, to be extended with further elaboration and deeper analysis of its intriguing properties."
Communication Separations for Truthful Auctions: Breaking the Two-Player Barrier,"We study the communication complexity of truthful combinatorial auctions, and in particular the case where valuations are either subadditive or single-minded, which we denote with $\mathsf{SubAdd}\cup\mathsf{SingleM}$. We show that for three bidders with valuations in $\mathsf{SubAdd}\cup\mathsf{SingleM}$, any deterministic truthful mechanism that achieves at least a $0.366$-approximation requires $\exp(m)$ communication. In contrast, a natural extension of [Fei09] yields a non-truthful $\mathrm{poly}(m)$-communication protocol that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, demonstrating a gap between the power of truthful mechanisms and non-truthful protocols for this problem.   Our approach follows the taxation complexity framework laid out in [Dob16b], but applies this framework in a setting not encompassed by the techniques used in past work. In particular, the only successful prior application of this framework uses a reduction to simultaneous protocols which only applies for two bidders [AKSW20], whereas our three-player lower bounds are stronger than what can possibly arise from a two-player construction (since a trivial truthful auction guarantees a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for two players)."
IFAdapter: Instance Feature Control for Grounded Text-to-Image Generation,"While Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating visually appealing images of individual instances, they struggle to accurately position and control the features generation of multiple instances. The Layout-to-Image (L2I) task was introduced to address the positioning challenges by incorporating bounding boxes as spatial control signals, but it still falls short in generating precise instance features. In response, we propose the Instance Feature Generation (IFG) task, which aims to ensure both positional accuracy and feature fidelity in generated instances. To address the IFG task, we introduce the Instance Feature Adapter (IFAdapter). The IFAdapter enhances feature depiction by incorporating additional appearance tokens and utilizing an Instance Semantic Map to align instance-level features with spatial locations. The IFAdapter guides the diffusion process as a plug-and-play module, making it adaptable to various community models. For evaluation, we contribute an IFG benchmark and develop a verification pipeline to objectively compare models' abilities to generate instances with accurate positioning and features. Experimental results demonstrate that IFAdapter outperforms other models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."
Source2Synth: Synthetic Data Generation and Curation Grounded in Real Data Sources,"Large Language Models still struggle in challenging scenarios that leverage structured data, complex reasoning, or tool usage. In this paper, we propose Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: we test reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines."
Multi-Model based Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attack: A Deep Learning Based Model Selection for MEC Systems,"Federated Learning (FL) enables training of a global model from distributed data, while preserving data privacy. However, the singular-model based operation of FL is open with uploading poisoned models compatible with the global model structure and can be exploited as a vulnerability to conduct model poisoning attacks. This paper proposes a multi-model based FL as a proactive mechanism to enhance the opportunity of model poisoning attack mitigation. A master model is trained by a set of slave models. To enhance the opportunity of attack mitigation, the structure of client models dynamically change within learning epochs, and the supporter FL protocol is provided. For a MEC system, the model selection problem is modeled as an optimization to minimize loss and recognition time, while meeting a robustness confidence. In adaption with dynamic network condition, a deep reinforcement learning based model selection is proposed. For a DDoS attack detection scenario, results illustrate a competitive accuracy gain under poisoning attack with the scenario that the system is without attack, and also a potential of recognition time improvement."
LLM Honeypot: Leveraging Large Language Models as Advanced Interactive Honeypot Systems,"The rapid evolution of cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions for detecting and analyzing malicious activity. Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure."
Towards Online Safety Corrections for Robotic Manipulation Policies,"Recent successes in applying reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics has shown it is a viable approach for constructing robotic controllers. However, RL controllers can produce many collisions in environments where new obstacles appear during execution. This poses a problem in safety-critical settings. We present a hybrid approach, called iKinQP-RL, that uses an Inverse Kinematics Quadratic Programming (iKinQP) controller to correct actions proposed by an RL policy at runtime. This ensures safe execution in the presence of new obstacles not present during training. Preliminary experiments illustrate our iKinQP-RL framework completely eliminates collisions with new obstacles while maintaining a high task success rate."
Model Ensemble for Brain Tumor Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Segmenting brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging enables performing quantitative analysis in support of clinical trials and personalized patient care. This analysis provides the potential to impact clinical decision-making processes, including diagnosis and prognosis. In 2023, the well-established Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge presented a substantial expansion with eight tasks and 4,500 brain tumor cases. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based ensemble strategy that is evaluated for newly included tumor cases in three tasks: pediatric brain tumors (PED), intracranial meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET). In particular, we ensemble outputs from state-of-the-art nnU-Net and Swin UNETR models on a region-wise basis. Furthermore, we implemented a targeted post-processing strategy based on a cross-validated threshold search to improve the segmentation results for tumor sub-regions. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen test cases for the three tasks resulted in lesion-wise Dice scores for PED: 0.653, 0.809, 0.826; MEN: 0.876, 0.867, 0.849; and MET: 0.555, 0.6, 0.58; for the enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively. Our method was ranked first for PED, third for MEN, and fourth for MET, respectively."
Design Optimization of Nuclear Fusion Reactor through Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This research explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the design of a nuclear fusion reactor. DRL can efficiently address the challenging issues attributed to multiple physics and engineering constraints for steady-state operation. The fusion reactor design computation and the optimization code applicable to parallelization with DRL are developed. The proposed framework enables finding the optimal reactor design that satisfies the operational requirements while reducing building costs. Multi-objective design optimization for a fusion reactor is now simplified by DRL, indicating the high potential of the proposed framework for advancing the efficient and sustainable design of future reactors."

Improving Initial Transients of Online Learning Echo State Network Control System via Feedback Adjustment,"Echo state networks (ESNs) have gained popularity in online learning control systems due to their easy training. However, online learning ESN controllers often undergo slow convergence and produce unexpected outputs during the initial transient stage. Existing solutions, such as prior training or control mode switching, can be complex and have drawbacks. This work offers a simple yet effective method to address these initial transients by integrating a feedback proportional-differential (P-D) controller into the online learning ESN control system. Simulations show that the proposed control system exhibits fast convergence in transients and strong robustness against plant dynamics and model hyperparameter changes. This work is expected to offer practical benefits for engineers seeking to implement online learning ESN control systems."
Towards Instance-Optimal Euclidean Spanners,"Euclidean spanners are important geometric objects that have been extensively studied since the 1980s. The two most basic ""compactness'' measures of a Euclidean spanner $E$ are the size (number of edges) $|E|$ and the weight (sum of edge weights) $\|E\|$. In this paper, we initiate the study of instance optimal Euclidean spanners. Our results are two-fold.   We demonstrate that the greedy spanner is far from being instance optimal, even when allowing its stretch to grow. More concretely, we design two hard instances of point sets in the plane, where the greedy $(1+x \epsilon)$-spanner (for basically any parameter $x \geq 1$) has $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1/2}) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $\Omega_x(\epsilon^{-1}) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$, where $E_\mathrm{spa}$ and $E_\mathrm{light}$ denote the per-instance sparsest and lightest $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners, respectively, and the $\Omega_x$ notation suppresses a polynomial dependence on $1/x$.   As our main contribution, we design a new construction of Euclidean spanners, which is inherently different from known constructions, achieving the following bounds: a stretch of $1+\epsilon\cdot 2^{O(\log^*(d/\epsilon))}$ with $O(1) \cdot |E_\mathrm{spa}|$ edges and weight $O(1) \cdot \|E_\mathrm{light}\|$. In other words, we show that a slight increase to the stretch suffices for obtaining instance optimality up to an absolute constant for both sparsity and lightness. Remarkably, there is only a log-star dependence on the dimension in the stretch, and there is no dependence on it whatsoever in the number of edges and weight."
Exploring Use and Perceptions of Generative AI Art Tools by Blind Artists,"The paper explores the intersection of AI art and blindness, as existing AI research has primarily focused on AI art's reception and impact, on sighted artists and consumers. To address this gap, the researcher interviewed six blind artists from various visual art mediums and levels of blindness about the generative AI image platform Midjourney. The participants shared text prompts and discussed their reactions to the generated images with the sighted researcher. The findings highlight blind artists' interest in AI images as a collaborative tool but express concerns about cultural perceptions and labeling of AI-generated art. They also underscore unique challenges, such as potential misunderstandings and stereotypes about blindness leading to exclusion. The study advocates for greater inclusion of blind individuals in AI art, emphasizing the need to address their specific needs and experiences in developing AI art technologies."
Multi-Robot Coordination Induced in Hazardous Environments through an Adversarial Graph-Traversal Game,"This paper presents a game theoretic formulation of a graph traversal problem, with applications to robots moving through hazardous environments in the presence of an adversary, as in military and security applications. The blue team of robots moves in an environment modeled by a time-varying graph, attempting to reach some goal with minimum cost, while the red team controls how the graph changes to maximize the cost. The problem is formulated as a stochastic game, so that Nash equilibrium strategies can be computed numerically. Bounds are provided for the game value, with a guarantee that it solves the original problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate the results and the effectiveness of this method, particularly showing the benefit of mixing actions for both players, as well as beneficial coordinated behavior, where blue robots split up and/or synchronize to traverse risky edges."
Tweezers: A Framework for Security Event Detection via Event Attribution-centric Tweet Embedding,"Twitter is recognized as a crucial platform for the dissemination and gathering of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Its capability to provide real-time, actionable intelligence makes it an indispensable tool for detecting security events, helping security professionals cope with ever-growing threats. However, the large volume of tweets and inherent noises of human-crafted tweets pose significant challenges in accurately identifying security events. While many studies tried to filter out event-related tweets based on keywords, they are not effective due to their limitation in understanding the semantics of tweets. Another challenge in security event detection from Twitter is the comprehensive coverage of security events. Previous studies emphasized the importance of early detection of security events, but they overlooked the importance of event coverage. To cope with these challenges, in our study, we introduce a novel event attribution-centric tweet embedding method to enable the high precision and coverage of events. Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms existing text and graph-based tweet embedding methods in identifying security events. Leveraging this novel embedding approach, we have developed and implemented a framework, Tweezers, that is applicable to security event detection from Twitter for CTI gathering. This framework has demonstrated its effectiveness, detecting twice as many events compared to established baselines. Additionally, we have showcased two applications, built on Tweezers for the integration and inspection of security events, i.e., security event trend analysis and informative security user identification."
Graph Inspection for Robotic Motion Planning: Do Arithmetic Circuits Help?,"We investigate whether algorithms based on arithmetic circuits are a viable alternative to existing solvers for Graph Inspection, a problem with direct application in robotic motion planning. Specifically, we seek to address the high memory usage of existing solvers. Aided by novel theoretical results enabling fast solution recovery, we implement a circuit-based solver for Graph Inspection which uses only polynomial space and test it on several realistic robotic motion planning datasets. In particular, we provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of a suite of engineered algorithms for three key subroutines. While this evaluation demonstrates that circuit-based methods are not yet practically competitive for our robotics application, it also provides insights which may guide future efforts to bring circuit-based algorithms from theory to practice."
CliquePH: Higher-Order Information for Graph Neural Networks through Persistent Homology on Clique Graphs,"Graph neural networks have become the default choice by practitioners for graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification. Nevertheless, popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture higher-order information, i.e., information that goes \emph{beyond} pairwise interactions. Recent work has shown that persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, can enrich graph neural networks with topological information that they otherwise could not capture. Calculating such features is efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles). However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does not scale well, with a complexity of $O(n^d)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d$ is the order of the structures. In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts information about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the efficient low-dimensional persistent homology algorithm. On standard benchmark datasets, we show that our method can lead to up to $31\%$ improvements in test accuracy."
LT3SD: Latent Trees for 3D Scene Diffusion,"We present LT3SD, a novel latent diffusion model for large-scale 3D scene generation. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown impressive results in 3D object generation, but are limited in spatial extent and quality when extended to 3D scenes. To generate complex and diverse 3D scene structures, we introduce a latent tree representation to effectively encode both lower-frequency geometry and higher-frequency detail in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. We can then learn a generative diffusion process in this latent 3D scene space, modeling the latent components of a scene at each resolution level. To synthesize large-scale scenes with varying sizes, we train our diffusion model on scene patches and synthesize arbitrary-sized output 3D scenes through shared diffusion generation across multiple scene patches. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of LT3SD for large-scale, high-quality unconditional 3D scene generation and for probabilistic completion for partial scene observations."
Adaptive Language-Guided Abstraction from Contrastive Explanations,"Many approaches to robot learning begin by inferring a reward function from a set of human demonstrations. To learn a good reward, it is necessary to determine which features of the environment are relevant before determining how these features should be used to compute reward. End-to-end methods for joint feature and reward learning (e.g., using deep networks or program synthesis techniques) often yield brittle reward functions that are sensitive to spurious state features. By contrast, humans can often generalizably learn from a small number of demonstrations by incorporating strong priors about what features of a demonstration are likely meaningful for a task of interest. How do we build robots that leverage this kind of background knowledge when learning from new demonstrations? This paper describes a method named ALGAE (Adaptive Language-Guided Abstraction from [Contrastive] Explanations) which alternates between using language models to iteratively identify human-meaningful features needed to explain demonstrated behavior, then standard inverse reinforcement learning techniques to assign weights to these features. Experiments across a variety of both simulated and real-world robot environments show that ALGAE learns generalizable reward functions defined on interpretable features using only small numbers of demonstrations. Importantly, ALGAE can recognize when features are missing, then extract and define those features without any human input -- making it possible to quickly and efficiently acquire rich representations of user behavior."
Graph Laplacian-based Bayesian Multi-fidelity Modeling,"We present a novel probabilistic approach for generating multi-fidelity data while accounting for errors inherent in both low- and high-fidelity data. In this approach a graph Laplacian constructed from the low-fidelity data is used to define a multivariate Gaussian prior density for the coordinates of the true data points. In addition, few high-fidelity data points are used to construct a conjugate likelihood term. Thereafter, Bayes rule is applied to derive an explicit expression for the posterior density which is also multivariate Gaussian. The maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimate of this density is selected to be the optimal multi-fidelity estimate. It is shown that the MAP estimate and the covariance of the posterior density can be determined through the solution of linear systems of equations. Thereafter, two methods, one based on spectral truncation and another based on a low-rank approximation, are developed to solve these equations efficiently. The multi-fidelity approach is tested on a variety of problems in solid and fluid mechanics with data that represents vectors of quantities of interest and discretized spatial fields in one and two dimensions. The results demonstrate that by utilizing a small fraction of high-fidelity data, the multi-fidelity approach can significantly improve the accuracy of a large collection of low-fidelity data points."
VI3DRM:Towards meticulous 3D Reconstruction from Sparse Views via Photo-Realistic Novel View Synthesis,"Recently, methods like Zero-1-2-3 have focused on single-view based 3D reconstruction and have achieved remarkable success. However, their predictions for unseen areas heavily rely on the inductive bias of large-scale pretrained diffusion models. Although subsequent work, such as DreamComposer, attempts to make predictions more controllable by incorporating additional views, the results remain unrealistic due to feature entanglement in the vanilla latent space, including factors such as lighting, material, and structure. To address these issues, we introduce the Visual Isotropy 3D Reconstruction Model (VI3DRM), a diffusion-based sparse views 3D reconstruction model that operates within an ID consistent and perspective-disentangled 3D latent space. By facilitating the disentanglement of semantic information, color, material properties and lighting, VI3DRM is capable of generating highly realistic images that are indistinguishable from real photographs. By leveraging both real and synthesized images, our approach enables the accurate construction of pointmaps, ultimately producing finely textured meshes or point clouds. On the NVS task, tested on the GSO dataset, VI3DRM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art method DreamComposer, achieving a PSNR of 38.61, an SSIM of 0.929, and an LPIPS of 0.027. Code will be made available upon publication."
ComAlign: Compositional Alignment in Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have showcased a remarkable ability to extract transferable features for downstream tasks. Nonetheless, the training process of these models is usually based on a coarse-grained contrastive loss between the global embedding of images and texts which may lose the compositional structure of these modalities. Many recent studies have shown VLMs lack compositional understandings like attribute binding and identifying object relationships. Although some recent methods have tried to achieve finer-level alignments, they either are not based on extracting meaningful components of proper granularity or don't properly utilize the modalities' correspondence (especially in image-text pairs with more ingredients). Addressing these limitations, we introduce Compositional Alignment (ComAlign), a fine-grained approach to discover more exact correspondence of text and image components using only the weak supervision in the form of image-text pairs. Our methodology emphasizes that the compositional structure (including entities and relations) extracted from the text modality must also be retained in the image modality. To enforce correspondence of fine-grained concepts in image and text modalities, we train a lightweight network lying on top of existing visual and language encoders using a small dataset. The network is trained to align nodes and edges of the structure across the modalities. Experimental results on various VLMs and datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval and compositional benchmarks, affirming the effectiveness of our plugin model."
What Makes a Maze Look Like a Maze?,"A unique aspect of human visual understanding is the ability to flexibly interpret abstract concepts: acquiring lifted rules explaining what they symbolize, grounding them across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and making predictions or reasoning about them. While off-the-shelf vision-language models excel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object categories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such visual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the walls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding (DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual abstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are schemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them into more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract schemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the schema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to augment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and different methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which consists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding question-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly improves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models, and is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions."
Machine Learning for Two-Sample Testing under Right-Censored Data: A Simulation Study,"The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) methods for two-sample testing with right-censored observations. To achieve this, we develop several ML-based methods with varying architectures and implement them as two-sample tests. Each method is an ensemble (stacking) that combines predictions from classical two-sample tests. This paper presents the results of training the proposed ML methods, examines their statistical power compared to classical two-sample tests, analyzes the distribution of test statistics for the proposed methods when the null hypothesis is true, and evaluates the significance of the features incorporated into the proposed methods. All results from numerical experiments were obtained from a synthetic dataset generated using the Smirnov transform (Inverse Transform Sampling) and replicated multiple times through Monte Carlo simulation. To test the two-sample problem with right-censored observations, one can use the proposed two-sample methods. All necessary materials (source code, example scripts, dataset, and samples) are available on GitHub and Hugging Face."
AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model,"Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench. The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/AudioBERT}."
Composing Option Sequences by Adaptation: Initial Results,"Robot manipulation in real-world settings often requires adapting the robot's behavior to the current situation, such as by changing the sequences in which policies execute to achieve the desired task. Problematically, however, we show that composing a novel sequence of five deep RL options to perform a pick-and-place task is unlikely to successfully complete, even if their initiation and termination conditions align. We propose a framework to determine whether sequences will succeed a priori, and examine three approaches that adapt options to sequence successfully if they will not. Crucially, our adaptation methods consider the actual subset of points that the option is trained from or where it ends: (1) trains the second option to start where the first ends; (2) trains the first option to reach the centroid of where the second starts; and (3) trains the first option to reach the median of where the second starts. Our results show that our framework and adaptation methods have promise in adapting options to work in novel sequences."
Optimal Operation of Distribution System Operator and the Impact of Peer-to-Peer Transactions,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, commonly recognized as a decentralized approach, has emerged as a popular way to better utilize distributed energy resources (DERs). In order to better manage this user-side decentralized approach from a system operator's point of view, this paper proposes an optimal operation approach for distribution system operators (DSO), comprising internal prosumers who engage in P2P transactions. The DSO is assumed to be a financial neutral entity, holding the responsibility of aggregating the surplus energy and deficit demand of prosumers after their P2P transactions while dispatching DERs and considering network integrity. Impacts of P2P transactions on DSO's optimal operation have been studied. Results indicate that energy matching P2P trading where only the total amount of energy over a given period of time is defined may affect quantities of energy exchanged between the DSO and the wholesale market, but not internal dispatch decisions of the DSO. Different levels of real-time power consistency may lead to different total surpluses in the distribution network. For the real-time power matching P2P trading, as a special case of energy matching P2P trading, the provided energy and total surplus are not affected. In other words, DSO can safely ignore P2P transactions if they follow the format defined in this paper. Case studies verify these conclusions and further demonstrate that P2P trading will not affect physical power flow of the whole system, but the financial distribution between the DSO and prosumers."
A Secure Standard for NFT Fractionalization,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer a unique method for representing digital and physical assets on the blockchain. However, the NFT market has recently experienced a downturn in interest, mainly due to challenges related to high entry barriers and limited market liquidity. Fractionalization emerges as a promising solution, allowing multiple parties to hold a stake in a single NFT. By breaking down ownership into fractional shares, this approach lowers the entry barrier for investors, enhances market liquidity, and democratizes access to valuable digital assets. Despite these benefits, the current landscape of NFT fractionalization is fragmented, with no standardized framework to guide the secure and interoperable implementation of fractionalization mechanisms. This paper contributions are twofold: first, we provide a detailed analysis of the current NFT fractionalization landscape focusing on security challenges; second, we introduce a standardized approach that addresses these challenges, paving the way for more secure, interoperable, and accessible NFT fractionalization platforms."
Gaussian Garments: Reconstructing Simulation-Ready Clothing with Photorealistic Appearance from Multi-View Video,"We introduce Gaussian Garments, a novel approach for reconstructing realistic simulation-ready garment assets from multi-view videos. Our method represents garments with a combination of a 3D mesh and a Gaussian texture that encodes both the color and high-frequency surface details. This representation enables accurate registration of garment geometries to multi-view videos and helps disentangle albedo textures from lighting effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a pre-trained graph neural network (GNN) can be fine-tuned to replicate the real behavior of each garment. The reconstructed Gaussian Garments can be automatically combined into multi-garment outfits and animated with the fine-tuned GNN."
Efficient Sparse Coding with the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech Classification,"Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 4 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency."
Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Entity Matching,"Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and their ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the model's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o Mini."
Enhancing Canine Musculoskeletal Diagnoses: Leveraging Synthetic Image Data for Pre-Training AI-Models on Visual Documentations,"The examination of the musculoskeletal system in dogs is a challenging task in veterinary practice. In this work, a novel method has been developed that enables efficient documentation of a dog's condition through a visual representation. However, since the visual documentation is new, there is no existing training data. The objective of this work is therefore to mitigate the impact of data scarcity in order to develop an AI-based diagnostic support system. To this end, the potential of synthetic data that mimics realistic visual documentations of diseases for pre-training AI models is investigated. We propose a method for generating synthetic image data that mimics realistic visual documentations. Initially, a basic dataset containing three distinct classes is generated, followed by the creation of a more sophisticated dataset containing 36 different classes. Both datasets are used for the pre-training of an AI model. Subsequently, an evaluation dataset is created, consisting of 250 manually created visual documentations for five different diseases. This dataset, along with a subset containing 25 examples. The obtained results on the evaluation dataset containing 25 examples demonstrate a significant enhancement of approximately 10% in diagnosis accuracy when utilizing generated synthetic images that mimic real-world visual documentations. However, these results do not hold true for the larger evaluation dataset containing 250 examples, indicating that the advantages of using synthetic data for pre-training an AI model emerge primarily when dealing with few examples of visual documentations for a given disease. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into mitigating the limitations imposed by limited training data through the strategic use of generated synthetic data, presenting an approach applicable beyond the canine musculoskeletal assessment domain."
Fermionic Gaussian Testing and Non-Gaussian Measures via Convolution,"We explore the properties of fermionic convolution defined by fermionic Gaussian unitary. A key finding is the purity invariance of pure Gaussian states under this convolution. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient protocol to test the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states by using 3 copies of the input states. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of measures called ``Non-Gaussian Entropy,'' designed to quantify the fermionic non-Gaussianity of states."
"Identification of head impact locations, speeds, and force based on head kinematics","Objective: Head impact information including impact directions, speeds and force are important to study traumatic brain injury, design and evaluate protective gears. This study presents a deep learning model developed to accurately predict head impact information, including location, speed, orientation, and force, based on head kinematics during helmeted impacts. Methods: Leveraging a dataset of 16,000 simulated helmeted head impacts using the Riddell helmet finite element model, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to process the head kinematics: tri-axial linear accelerations and angular velocities. Results: The models accurately predict the impact parameters describing impact location, direction, speed, and the impact force profile with R2 exceeding 70% for all tasks. Further validation was conducted using an on-field dataset recorded by instrumented mouthguards and videos, consisting of 79 head impacts in which the impact location can be clearly identified. The deep learning model significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving a 79.7% accuracy in identifying impact locations, compared to lower accuracies with traditional methods (the highest accuracy of existing methods is 49.4%). Conclusion: The precision underscores the model's potential in enhancing helmet design and safety in sports by providing more accurate impact data. Future studies should test the models across various helmets and sports on large in vivo datasets to validate the accuracy of the models, employing techniques like transfer learning to broaden its effectiveness."
Co-badge: An Activity for Collaborative Engagement with Data Visualization Design Concepts,"As data visualization gains popularity and projects become more interdisciplinary, there is a growing need for methods that foster creative collaboration and inform diverse audiences about data visualisation. In this paper, we introduce Co-Badge, a 90-minute design activity where participants collaboratively construct visualizations by ideating and prioritizing relevant data types, mapping them to visual variables, and constructing data badges with stationery materials. We conducted three workshops in diverse settings with participants of different backgrounds. Our findings indicate that Co-badge facilitates a playful and engaging way to gain awareness about data visualization design principles without formal training while navigating the challenges of collaboration. Our work contributes to the field of data visualization education for diverse actors. We believe Co-Badge can serve as an engaging activity that introduces basic concepts of data visualization and collaboration."
Low-Cost Tree Crown Dieback Estimation Using Deep Learning-Based Segmentation,"The global increase in observed forest dieback, characterised by the death of tree foliage, heralds widespread decline in forest ecosystems. This degradation causes significant changes to ecosystem services and functions, including habitat provision and carbon sequestration, which can be difficult to detect using traditional monitoring techniques, highlighting the need for large-scale and high-frequency monitoring. Contemporary developments in the instruments and methods to gather and process data at large-scales mean this monitoring is now possible. In particular, the advancement of low-cost drone technology and deep learning on consumer-level hardware provide new opportunities. Here, we use an approach based on deep learning and vegetation indices to assess crown dieback from RGB aerial data without the need for expensive instrumentation such as LiDAR. We use an iterative approach to match crown footprints predicted by deep learning with field-based inventory data from a Mediterranean ecosystem exhibiting drought-induced dieback, and compare expert field-based crown dieback estimation with vegetation index-based estimates. We obtain high overall segmentation accuracy (mAP: 0.519) without the need for additional technical development of the underlying Mask R-CNN model, underscoring the potential of these approaches for non-expert use and proving their applicability to real-world conservation. We also find colour-coordinate based estimates of dieback correlate well with expert field-based estimation. Substituting ground truth for Mask R-CNN model predictions showed negligible impact on dieback estimates, indicating robustness. Our findings demonstrate the potential of automated data collection and processing, including the application of deep learning, to improve the coverage, speed and cost of forest dieback monitoring."
AD-Lite Net: A Lightweight and Concatenated CNN Model for Alzheimer's Detection from MRI Images,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a non-curable progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the human brain, leading to a decline in memory, cognitive abilities, and eventually, the ability to carry out daily tasks. Manual diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images is fraught with less sensitivity and it is a very tedious process for neurologists. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) system, which can detect AD at early stages with higher accuracy. In this research, we have proposed a novel AD-Lite Net model (trained from scratch), that could alleviate the aforementioned problem. The novelties we bring here in this research are, (I) We have proposed a very lightweight CNN model by incorporating Depth Wise Separable Convolutional (DWSC) layers and Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers. (II) We have leveraged a ``parallel concatenation block'' (pcb), in the proposed AD-Lite Net model. This pcb consists of a Transformation layer (Tx-layer), followed by two convolutional layers, which are thereby concatenated with the original base model. This Tx-layer converts the features into very distinct kind of features, which are imperative for the Alzheimer's disease. As a consequence, the proposed AD-Lite Net model with ``parallel concatenation'' converges faster and automatically mitigates the class imbalance problem from the MRI datasets in a very generalized way. For the validity of our proposed model, we have implemented it on three different MRI datasets. Furthermore, we have combined the ADNI and AD datasets and subsequently performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment to verify the model's generalization ability. Extensive experimental results showed that our proposed model has outperformed all the existing CNN models, and one recent trend Vision Transformer (ViT) model by a significant margin."
Learning to Match 2D Keypoints Across Preoperative MR and Intraoperative Ultrasound,"We propose in this paper a texture-invariant 2D keypoints descriptor specifically designed for matching preoperative Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with intraoperative Ultrasound (US) images. We introduce a matching-by-synthesis strategy, where intraoperative US images are synthesized from MR images accounting for multiple MR modalities and intraoperative US variability. We build our training set by enforcing keypoints localization over all images then train a patient-specific descriptor network that learns texture-invariant discriminant features in a supervised contrastive manner, leading to robust keypoints descriptors. Our experiments on real cases with ground truth show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods and achieving 80.35% matching precision on average."
High-Frequency Anti-DreamBooth: Robust Defense Against Image Synthesis,"Recently, text-to-image generative models have been misused to create unauthorized malicious images of individuals, posing a growing social problem. Previous solutions, such as Anti-DreamBooth, add adversarial noise to images to protect them from being used as training data for malicious generation. However, we found that the adversarial noise can be removed by adversarial purification methods such as DiffPure. Therefore, we propose a new adversarial attack method that adds strong perturbation on the high-frequency areas of images to make it more robust to adversarial purification. Our experiment showed that the adversarial images retained noise even after adversarial purification, hindering malicious image generation."
Collaborating for Success: Optimizing System Efficiency and Resilience Under Agile Industrial Settings,"Designing an efficient and resilient human-robot collaboration strategy that not only upholds the safety and ergonomics of shared workspace but also enhances the performance and agility of collaborative setup presents significant challenges concerning environment perception and robot control. In this research, we introduce a novel approach for collaborative environment monitoring and robot motion regulation to address this multifaceted problem. Our study proposes novel computation and division of safety monitoring zones, adhering to ISO 13855 and TS 15066 standards, utilizing 2D lasers information. These zones are not only configured in the standard three-layer arrangement but are also expanded into two adjacent quadrants, thereby enhancing system uptime and preventing unnecessary deadlocks. Moreover, we also leverage 3D visual information to track dynamic human articulations and extended intrusions. Drawing upon the fused sensory data from 2D and 3D perceptual spaces, our proposed hierarchical controller stably regulates robot velocity, validated using Lasalle in-variance principle. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces task execution time and system response delay, resulting in improved efficiency and resilience within collaborative settings."
Open Source Infrastructure for Automatic Cell Segmentation,"Automated cell segmentation is crucial for various biological and medical applications, facilitating tasks like cell counting, morphology analysis, and drug discovery. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity, necessitating robust automated methods. This paper presents open-source infrastructure, utilizing the UNet model, a deep-learning architecture noted for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. This implementation is integrated into the open-source DeepChem package, enhancing accessibility and usability for researchers and practitioners. The resulting tool offers a convenient and user-friendly interface, reducing the barrier to entry for cell segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we benchmark this model against various datasets, demonstrating its robustness and versatility across different imaging conditions and cell types."
Cross-Attention Based Influence Model for Manual and Nonmanual Sign Language Analysis,"Both manual (relating to the use of hands) and non-manual markers (NMM), such as facial expressions or mouthing cues, are important for providing the complete meaning of phrases in American Sign Language (ASL). Efforts have been made in advancing sign language to spoken/written language understanding, but most of these have primarily focused on manual features only. In this work, using advanced neural machine translation methods, we examine and report on the extent to which facial expressions contribute to understanding sign language phrases. We present a sign language translation architecture consisting of two-stream encoders, with one encoder handling the face and the other handling the upper body (with hands). We propose a new parallel cross-attention decoding mechanism that is useful for quantifying the influence of each input modality on the output. The two streams from the encoder are directed simultaneously to different attention stacks in the decoder. Examining the properties of the parallel cross-attention weights allows us to analyze the importance of facial markers compared to body and hand features during a translating task."
A Study on Asynchronous Vote-based Blockchains,"Vote-based blockchains construct a state machine replication (SMR) system among participating nodes, using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols to transition from one state to another. Currently, they rely on either synchronous or partially synchronous networks with leader-based coordination or costly Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocols in asynchronous settings, making them impractical for large-scale asynchronous applications.   To make Asynchronous SMR scalable, this paper proposes a \emph{validated strong} BFT consensus model that allows leader-based coordination in asynchronous settings. Our BFT consensus model offers the same level of tolerance as binary byzantine agreement but does not demand consistency among honest nodes before they vote. An SMR using our model allows nodes to operate in different, tentative, but mutually exclusive states until they eventually converge on the same state. We propose an asynchronous BFT protocol for vote-based blockchains employing our consensus model to address several critical challenges: how to ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state across voting rounds, how to assure that a blockchain will steadily progress through epochs while reaching consensus for previous epochs, and how to maintain robust byzantine fault tolerance.   Our protocol greatly reduces message complexity and is the first one to achieve linear view changes without relying on threshold signatures. We prove that an asynchronous blockchain built on our protocol can operate with the \emph{same} simplicity and efficiency as partially synchronous blockchains built on, e.g. HotStuff-2. This facilitates deploying asynchronous blockchains across large-scale networks."
On the Role of Context in Reading Time Prediction,"We present a new perspective on how readers integrate context during real-time language comprehension. Our proposals build on surprisal theory, which posits that the processing effort of a linguistic unit (e.g., a word) is an affine function of its in-context information content. We first observe that surprisal is only one out of many potential ways that a contextual predictor can be derived from a language model. Another one is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between a unit and its context, which turns out to yield the same predictive power as surprisal when controlling for unigram frequency. Moreover, both PMI and surprisal are correlated with frequency. This means that neither PMI nor surprisal contains information about context alone. In response to this, we propose a technique where we project surprisal onto the orthogonal complement of frequency, yielding a new contextual predictor that is uncorrelated with frequency. Our experiments show that the proportion of variance in reading times explained by context is a lot smaller when context is represented by the orthogonalized predictor. From an interpretability standpoint, this indicates that previous studies may have overstated the role that context has in predicting reading times."
SDformer: Efficient End-to-End Transformer for Depth Completion,"Depth completion aims to predict dense depth maps with sparse depth measurements from a depth sensor. Currently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models are the most popular methods applied to depth completion tasks. However, despite the excellent high-end performance, they suffer from a limited representation area. To overcome the drawbacks of CNNs, a more effective and powerful method has been presented: the Transformer, which is an adaptive self-attention setting sequence-to-sequence model. While the standard Transformer quadratically increases the computational cost from the key-query dot-product of input resolution which improperly employs depth completion tasks. In this work, we propose a different window-based Transformer architecture for depth completion tasks named Sparse-to-Dense Transformer (SDformer). The network consists of an input module for the depth map and RGB image features extraction and concatenation, a U-shaped encoder-decoder Transformer for extracting deep features, and a refinement module. Specifically, we first concatenate the depth map features with the RGB image features through the input model. Then, instead of calculating self-attention with the whole feature maps, we apply different window sizes to extract the long-range depth dependencies. Finally, we refine the predicted features from the input module and the U-shaped encoder-decoder Transformer module to get the enriching depth features and employ a convolution layer to obtain the dense depth map. In practice, the SDformer obtains state-of-the-art results against the CNN-based depth completion models with lower computing loads and parameters on the NYU Depth V2 and KITTI DC datasets."
Disinfectant Control in Drinking Water Networks: Integrating Advection-Dispersion-Reaction Models and Byproduct Constraints,"Effective disinfection is essential for maintaining water quality standards in distribution networks. Chlorination, as the most used technique, ensures safe water by maintaining sufficient chlorine residuals but also leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). These DBPs pose health risks, highlighting the need for chlorine injection control (CIC) by booster stations to balance safety and DBPs formation. Prior studies have followed various approaches to address this research problem. However, most of these studies overlook the changing flow conditions and their influence on the evolution of the chlorine and DBPs concentrations by integrating simplified transport-reaction models into CIC. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel CIC method that: (i) integrates multi-species dynamics, (ii) allows for a more accurate representation of the reaction dynamics of chlorine, other substances, and the resulting DBPs formation, and (iii) optimizes for the regulation of chlorine concentrations subject to EPA mandates thereby mitigating network-wide DBPs formation. The novelty of this study lies in its incorporation of time-dependent controllability analysis that captures the control coverage of each booster station. The effectiveness of the proposed CIC method is demonstrated through its application and validation via numerical case studies on different water networks with varying scales, initial conditions, and parameters."
MagicStyle: Portrait Stylization Based on Reference Image,"The development of diffusion models has significantly advanced the research on image stylization, particularly in the area of stylizing a content image based on a given style image, which has attracted many scholars. The main challenge in this reference image stylization task lies in how to maintain the details of the content image while incorporating the color and texture features of the style image. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when the content image is a portrait which has complex textural details. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model-based reference image stylization method specifically for portraits, called MagicStyle. MagicStyle consists of two phases: Content and Style DDIM Inversion (CSDI) and Feature Fusion Forward (FFF). The CSDI phase involves a reverse denoising process, where DDIM Inversion is performed separately on the content image and the style image, storing the self-attention query, key and value features of both images during the inversion process. The FFF phase executes forward denoising, harmoniously integrating the texture and color information from the pre-stored feature queries, keys and values into the diffusion generation process based on our Well-designed Feature Fusion Attention (FFA). We conducted comprehensive comparative and ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MagicStyle and FFA."
Faster Speech-LLaMA Inference with Multi-token Prediction,"Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at solving a wide variety of tasks, including those involving multi-modal inputs. In particular, instantiating an LLM (such as LLaMA) with a speech encoder and training it on paired data imparts speech recognition (ASR) abilities to the decoder-only model, hence called Speech-LLaMA. Nevertheless, due to the sequential nature of auto-regressive inference and the relatively large decoder, Speech-LLaMA models require relatively high inference time. In this work, we propose to speed up Speech-LLaMA inference by predicting multiple tokens in the same decoding step. We explore several model architectures that enable this, and investigate their performance using threshold-based and verification-based inference strategies. We also propose a prefix-based beam search decoding method that allows efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training for such models. We evaluate our models on a variety of public benchmarks, where they reduce the number of decoder calls by ~3.2x while maintaining or improving WER performance."
LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with Large Language Models,"Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' ""Policies, Persona, and Perspective"" (3P) and how they resonate with the ""Interests, Ideologies, and Identity"" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation."
Inertial Coordination Games,"We analyze inertial coordination games: dynamic coordination games with an endogenously changing state that depends on (i) a persistent fundamental that players privately learn about; and (ii) past play. We give a tight characterization of how the speed of learning shapes equilibrium dynamics: the risk-dominant action is selected in the limit if and only if learning is slow such that posterior precisions grow sub-quadratically. This generalizes results from static global games and endows them with an alternate learning foundation. Conversely, when learning is fast, equilibrium dynamics exhibit persistence and limit play is shaped by initial play. Whenever the risk dominant equilibrium is selected, the path of play undergoes a sudden transition when signals are precise, and a gradual transition when signals are noisy."
Effective Segmentation of Post-Treatment Gliomas Using Simple Approaches: Artificial Sequence Generation and Ensemble Models,"Segmentation is a crucial task in the medical imaging field and is often an important primary step or even a prerequisite to the analysis of medical volumes. Yet treatments such as surgery complicate the accurate delineation of regions of interest. The BraTS Post-Treatment 2024 Challenge published the first public dataset for post-surgery glioma segmentation and addresses the aforementioned issue by fostering the development of automated segmentation tools for glioma in MRI data. In this effort, we propose two straightforward approaches to enhance the segmentation performances of deep learning-based methodologies. First, we incorporate an additional input based on a simple linear combination of the available MRI sequences input, which highlights enhancing tumors. Second, we employ various ensembling methods to weigh the contribution of a battery of models. Our results demonstrate that these approaches significantly improve segmentation performance compared to baseline models, underscoring the effectiveness of these simple approaches in improving medical image segmentation tasks."
"Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent Interconnects","Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. We argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. We quantitatively demonstrate these advantages using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions. Moreover, we show that while these advantages are significant over a modern PCIe peripheral bus, a truly cache-coherent interconnect offers significant additional efficiency gains."
Ranked Enumeration for Database Queries,"Ranked enumeration is a query-answering paradigm where the query answers are returned incrementally in order of importance (instead of returning all answers at once). Importance is defined by a ranking function that can be specific to the application, but typically involves either a lexicographic order (e.g., ""ORDER BY R.A, S.B"" in SQL) or a weighted sum of attributes (e.g., ""ORDER BY 3*R.A + 2*S.B""). We recently introduced any-k algorithms for (multi-way) join queries, which push ranking into joins and avoid materializing intermediate results until necessary. The top-ranked answers are returned asymptotically faster than the common join-then-rank approach of database systems, resulting in orders-of-magnitude speedup in practice.   In addition to their practical usefulness, our techniques complement a long line of theoretical research on unranked enumeration, where answers are also returned incrementally, but with no explicit ordering requirement. For a broad class of ranking functions with certain monotonicity properties, including lexicographic orders and sum-based rankings, the ordering requirement surprisingly does not increase the asymptotic time or space complexity, apart from logarithmic factors.   A key insight of our work is the connection between ranked enumeration for database queries and the fundamental task of computing the kth-shortest path in a graph. Uncovering these connections allowed us to ground our approach in the rich literature of that problem and connect ideas that had been explored in isolation before. In this article, we adopt a pragmatic approach and present a slightly simplified version of the algorithm without the shortest-path interpretation. We believe that this will benefit practitioners looking to implement and optimize any-k approaches."
The mutual pulling force of human muscle fibers can treat mild cancer and rhinitis,"Muscles can store a large amount of genetic information, and in order to transform humans into computers, we need to start by increasing muscle tension. When people with cancer go on happy trips, some cancers often heal without treatment; Rhinitis can cause blockage of the nostrils, but after running, the nostrils naturally ventilate. Both are related to exercise, and the mystery behind them can treat both conditions. Cancer belongs to systemic diseases, and the eradication method for systemic diseases should start from the entire body system, treat the symptoms and prevent recurrence. This article uses special exercise methods and detailed methods to treat diseases, and finds that treating diseases from the perspective of the human system is indeed effective. This article adopts a comparative experimental method to compare the changes in the body before and after. Through this article, it is concluded that exercise and certain methods can cure mild rhinitis and promote rapid ventilation; Explaining from the perspective of muscle pulling force that older individuals are more prone to developing cellular variant cancer; Enhancing muscle tension in the human body can promote the cure of some cancers"
Reducing Population-level Inequality Can Improve Demographic Group Fairness: a Twitter Case Study,"Many existing fairness metrics measure group-wise demographic disparities in system behavior or model performance. Calculating these metrics requires access to demographic information, which, in industrial settings, is often unavailable. By contrast, economic inequality metrics, such as the Gini coefficient, require no demographic data to measure. However, reductions in economic inequality do not necessarily correspond to reductions in demographic disparities. In this paper, we empirically explore the relationship between demographic-free inequality metrics -- such as the Gini coefficient -- and standard demographic bias metrics that measure group-wise model performance disparities specifically in the case of engagement inequality on Twitter. We analyze tweets from 174K users over the duration of 2021 and find that demographic-free impression inequality metrics are positively correlated with gender, race, and age disparities in the average case, and weakly (but still positively) correlated with demographic bias in the worst case. We therefore recommend inequality metrics as a potentially useful proxy measure of average group-wise disparities, especially in cases where such disparities cannot be measured directly. Based on these results, we believe they can be used as part of broader efforts to improve fairness between demographic groups in scenarios like content recommendation on social media."
Optimal Management of Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings via Safe Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have achieved significant success in managing grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). However, RL does not carry intrinsic guarantees of constraint satisfaction, which may lead to severe safety consequences. Besides, in GEB control applications, most existing safe RL approaches rely only on the regularisation parameters in neural networks or penalty of rewards, which often encounter challenges with parameter tuning and lead to catastrophic constraint violations. To provide enforced safety guarantees in controlling GEBs, this paper designs a physics-inspired safe RL method whose decision-making is enhanced through safe interaction with the environment. Different energy resources in GEBs are optimally managed to minimize energy costs and maximize customer comfort. The proposed approach can achieve strict constraint guarantees based on prior knowledge of a set of developed hard steady-state rules. Simulations on the optimal management of GEBs, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), solar photovoltaics, and energy storage systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
The JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding Standard: Serving Man and Machine,"Efficient point cloud coding has become increasingly critical for multiple applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and digital twin systems, where rich and interactive 3D data representations may functionally make the difference. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering advanced techniques for compressing point clouds more efficiently than conventional coding methods while also allowing effective computer vision tasks performed in the compressed domain thus, for the first time, making available a common compressed visual representation effective for both man and machine. Taking advantage of this potential, JPEG has recently finalized the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard offering efficient lossy coding of static point clouds, targeting both human visualization and machine processing by leveraging deep learning models for geometry and color coding. The geometry is processed directly in its original 3D form using sparse convolutional neural networks, while the color data is projected onto 2D images and encoded using the also learning-based JPEG AI standard. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete technical description of the JPEG PCC standard, along with a thorough benchmarking of its performance against the state-of-the-art, while highlighting its main strengths and weaknesses. In terms of compression performance, JPEG PCC outperforms the conventional MPEG PCC standards, especially in geometry coding, achieving significant rate reductions. Color compression performance is less competitive but this is overcome by the power of a full learning-based coding framework for both geometry and color and the associated effective compressed domain processing."
Theoretical guarantees in KL for Diffusion Flow Matching,"Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows) stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$, leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumptions on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, we establish bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $L^2$-drift-approximation error assumption."
GAZEploit: Remote Keystroke Inference Attack by Gaze Estimation from Avatar Views in VR/MR Devices,"The advent and growing popularity of Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) solutions have revolutionized the way we interact with digital platforms. The cutting-edge gaze-controlled typing methods, now prevalent in high-end models of these devices, e.g., Apple Vision Pro, have not only improved user experience but also mitigated traditional keystroke inference attacks that relied on hand gestures, head movements and acoustic side-channels. However, this advancement has paradoxically given birth to a new, potentially more insidious cyber threat, GAZEploit.   In this paper, we unveil GAZEploit, a novel eye-tracking based attack specifically designed to exploit these eye-tracking information by leveraging the common use of virtual appearances in VR applications. This widespread usage significantly enhances the practicality and feasibility of our attack compared to existing methods. GAZEploit takes advantage of this vulnerability to remotely extract gaze estimations and steal sensitive keystroke information across various typing scenarios-including messages, passwords, URLs, emails, and passcodes. Our research, involving 30 participants, achieved over 80% accuracy in keystroke inference. Alarmingly, our study also identified over 15 top-rated apps in the Apple Store as vulnerable to the GAZEploit attack, emphasizing the urgent need for bolstered security measures for this state-of-the-art VR/MR text entry method."
Duality theory in linear optimization and its extensions -- formally verified,"Farkas established that a system of linear inequalities has a solution if and only if we cannot obtain a contradiction by taking a linear combination of the inequalities. We state and formally prove several Farkas-like theorems over linearly ordered fields in Lean 4. Furthermore, we extend duality theory to the case when some coefficients are allowed to take ``infinite values''."
Value of Communication: Data-Driven Topology Optimization for Distributed Linear Cyber-Physical Systems,"Communication topology is a crucial part of a distributed control implementation for cyber-physical systems, yet is typically treated as a constraint within control design problems rather than a design variable. We propose a data-driven method for designing an optimal topology for the purpose of distributed control when a system model is unavailable or unaffordable, via a mixed-integer second-order conic program. The approach demonstrates improved control performance over random topologies in simulations and efficiently drops links which have a small effect on predictor accuracy, which we show correlates well with closed-loop control cost."
Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,"The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations."
Linear Complementary Dual Codes Constructed from Reinforcement Learning,"Recently, Linear Complementary Dual (LCD) codes have garnered substantial interest within coding theory research due to their diverse applications and favorable attributes. This paper directs its attention to the construction of binary and ternary LCD codes leveraging curiosity-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By establishing reward and devising well-reasoned mappings from actions to states, it aims to facilitate the successful synthesis of binary or ternary LCD codes. Experimental results indicate that LCD codes constructed using RL exhibit slightly superior error-correction performance compared to those conventionally constructed LCD codes and those developed via standard RL methodologies. The paper introduces novel binary and ternary LCD codes with enhanced minimum distance bounds. Finally, it showcases how Random Network Distillation aids agents in exploring beyond local optima, enhancing the overall performance of the models without compromising convergence."
Towards a graph-based foundation model for network traffic analysis,"Foundation models have shown great promise in various fields of study. A potential application of such models is in computer network traffic analysis, where these models can grasp the complexities of network traffic dynamics and adapt to any specific task or network environment with minimal fine-tuning. Previous approaches have used tokenized hex-level packet data and the model architecture of large language transformer models. We propose a new, efficient graph-based alternative at the flow-level. Our approach represents network traffic as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph, employing a self-supervised link prediction pretraining task to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics in this network graph framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a few-shot learning experiment for three distinct downstream network tasks: intrusion detection, traffic classification, and botnet classification. Models finetuned from our pretrained base achieve an average performance increase of 6.87\% over training from scratch, demonstrating their ability to effectively learn general network traffic dynamics during pretraining. This success suggests the potential for a large-scale version to serve as an operational foundational model."
"Microarchitectural comparison and in-core modeling of state-of-the-art CPUs: Grace, Sapphire Rapids, and Genoa","With Nvidia's release of the Grace Superchip, all three big semiconductor companies in HPC (AMD, Intel, Nvidia) are currently competing in the race for the best CPU. In this work we analyze the performance of these state-of-the-art CPUs and create an accurate in-core performance model for their microarchitectures Zen 4, Golden Cove, and Neoverse V2, extending the Open Source Architecture Code Analyzer (OSACA) tool and comparing it with LLVM-MCA. Starting from the peculiarities and up- and downsides of a single core, we extend our comparison by a variety of microbenchmarks and the capabilities of a full node. The ""write-allocate (WA) evasion"" feature, which can automatically reduce the memory traffic caused by write misses, receives special attention; we show that the Grace Superchip has a next-to-optimal implementation of WA evasion, and that the only way to avoid write allocates on Zen 4 is the explicit use of non-temporal stores."
WhisperNER: Unified Open Named Entity and Speech Recognition,"Integrating named entity recognition (NER) with automatic speech recognition (ASR) can significantly enhance transcription accuracy and informativeness. In this paper, we introduce WhisperNER, a novel model that allows joint speech transcription and entity recognition. WhisperNER supports open-type NER, enabling recognition of diverse and evolving entities at inference. Building on recent advancements in open NER research, we augment a large synthetic dataset with synthetic speech samples. This allows us to train WhisperNER on a large number of examples with diverse NER tags. During training, the model is prompted with NER labels and optimized to output the transcribed utterance along with the corresponding tagged entities. To evaluate WhisperNER, we generate synthetic speech for commonly used NER benchmarks and annotate existing ASR datasets with open NER tags. Our experiments demonstrate that WhisperNER outperforms natural baselines on both out-of-domain open type NER and supervised finetuning."
Hypergraph Change Point Detection using Adapted Cardinality-Based Gadgets: Applications in Dynamic Legal Structures,"Hypergraphs provide a robust framework for modeling complex systems with higher-order interactions. However, analyzing them in dynamic settings presents significant computational challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel method that adapts the cardinality-based gadget to convert hypergraphs into strongly connected weighted directed graphs, complemented by a symmetrized combinatorial Laplacian. We demonstrate that the harmonic mean of the conductance and edge expansion of the original hypergraph can be upper-bounded by the conductance of the transformed directed graph, effectively preserving crucial cut information. Additionally, we analyze how the resulting Laplacian relates to that derived from the star expansion. Our approach was validated through change point detection experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, showing superior performance over clique and star expansions in maintaining spectral information in dynamic settings. Finally, we applied our method to analyze a dynamic legal hypergraph constructed from extensive United States court opinion data."
"DEMAU: Decompose, Explore, Model and Analyse Uncertainties","Recent research in machine learning has given rise to a flourishing literature on the quantification and decomposition of model uncertainty. This information can be very useful during interactions with the learner, such as in active learning or adaptive learning, and especially in uncertainty sampling. To allow a simple representation of these total, epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties, we offer DEMAU, an open-source educational, exploratory and analytical tool allowing to visualize and explore several types of uncertainty for classification models in machine learning."
Designing a Collaborative Platform for Advancing Supply Chain Transparency,"Enabling supply chain transparency (SCT) is essential for regulatory compliance and meeting sustainability standards. Multi-tier SCT plays a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating an organization's operational, environmental, and social (ESG) risks. While research observes increasing efforts towards SCT, a minority of companies are currently publishing supply chain information. Using the Design Science Research approach, we develop a collaborative platform for supply chain transparency. We derive design requirements, formulate design principles, and evaluate the artefact with industry experts. Our artefact is initialized with publicly available supply chain data through an automated pipeline designed to onboard future participants to our platform. This work contributes to SCT research by providing insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing multi-tier SCT and offers a practical solution that encourages organizations to participate in a transparent ecosystem."
The Faetar Benchmark: Speech Recognition in a Very Under-Resourced Language,"We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Proven\c{c}al variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Proven\c{c}al. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set."
Bayesian Self-Training for Semi-Supervised 3D Segmentation,"3D segmentation is a core problem in computer vision and, similarly to many other dense prediction tasks, it requires large amounts of annotated data for adequate training. However, densely labeling 3D point clouds to employ fully-supervised training remains too labor intensive and expensive. Semi-supervised training provides a more practical alternative, where only a small set of labeled data is given, accompanied by a larger unlabeled set. This area thus studies the effective use of unlabeled data to reduce the performance gap that arises due to the lack of annotations. In this work, inspired by Bayesian deep learning, we first propose a Bayesian self-training framework for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation. Employing stochastic inference, we generate an initial set of pseudo-labels and then filter these based on estimated point-wise uncertainty. By constructing a heuristic $n$-partite matching algorithm, we extend the method to semi-supervised 3D instance segmentation, and finally, with the same building blocks, to dense 3D visual grounding. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results for our semi-supervised method on SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI for 3D semantic segmentation and on ScanNet and S3DIS for 3D instance segmentation. We further achieve substantial improvements in dense 3D visual grounding over supervised-only baselines on ScanRefer. Our project page is available at ouenal.github.io/bst/."
Testing the Test: Observations When Assessing Visualization Literacy of Domain Experts,"Various standardized tests exist that assess individuals' visualization literacy. Their use can help to draw conclusions from studies. However, it is not taken into account that the test itself can create a pressure situation where participants might fear being exposed and assessed negatively. This is especially problematic when testing domain experts in design studies. We conducted interviews with experts from different domains performing the Mini-VLAT test for visualization literacy to identify potential problems. Our participants reported that the time limit per question, ambiguities in the questions and visualizations, and missing steps in the test procedure mainly had an impact on their performance and content. We discuss possible changes to the test design to address these issues and how such assessment methods could be integrated into existing evaluation procedures."
The CLC-UKET Dataset: Benchmarking Case Outcome Prediction for the UK Employment Tribunal,"This paper explores the intersection of technological innovation and access to justice by developing a benchmark for predicting case outcomes in the UK Employment Tribunal (UKET). To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution."
Optimizing Falsification for Learning-Based Control Systems: A Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Approach,"Testing controllers in safety-critical systems is vital for ensuring their safety and preventing failures. In this paper, we address the falsification problem within learning-based closed-loop control systems through simulation. This problem involves the identification of counterexamples that violate system safety requirements and can be formulated as an optimization task based on these requirements. Using full-fidelity simulator data in this optimization problem can be computationally expensive. To improve efficiency, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization falsification framework that harnesses simulators with varying levels of accuracy. Our proposed framework can transition between different simulators and establish meaningful relationships between them. Through multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, we determine both the optimal system input likely to be a counterexample and the appropriate fidelity level for assessment. We evaluated our approach across various Gym environments, each featuring different levels of fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization is more computationally efficient than full-fidelity Bayesian optimization and other baseline methods in detecting counterexamples. A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/SAILRIT/MFBO_Falsification."
Impacts of EPA Power Plant Emissions Regulations on the US Electricity Sector,"Taking aim at one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting sectors, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized new regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions in May 2024. These rules take the form of different emissions performance standards for different classes of power plant technologies, creating a complex set of regulations that make it difficult to understand their consequential impacts on power system capacity, operations, and emissions without dedicated and sophisticated modeling. Here, we enhance a state-of-the-art power system capacity expansion model by incorporating new detailed operational constraints tailored to different technologies to represent the EPA's rules. Our results show that adopting these new regulations could reduce US power sector emissions in 2040 to 51% below the 2022 level (vs 26% without the rules). Regulations on coal-fired power plants drive the largest share of reductions. Regulations on new gas turbines incrementally reduce emissions but lower overall efficiency of the gas fleet, increasing the average cost of carbon mitigation. Therefore, we explore several alternative emission mitigation strategies. By comparing these alternatives with regulations finalized by EPA, we highlight the importance of accelerating the retirement of inefficient fossil fuel-fired generators and applying consistent and strict emissions regulations to all gas generators, regardless of their vintage, to cost-effectively achieve deep decarbonization and avoid biasing investment decisions towards less efficient generators."
EZIGen: Enhancing zero-shot subject-driven image generation with precise subject encoding and decoupled guidance,"Zero-shot subject-driven image generation aims to produce images that incorporate a subject from a given example image. The challenge lies in preserving the subject's identity while aligning with the text prompt, which often requires modifying certain aspects of the subject's appearance. Despite advancements in diffusion model based methods, existing approaches still struggle to balance identity preservation with text prompt alignment. In this study, we conducted an in-depth investigation into this issue and uncovered key insights for achieving effective identity preservation while maintaining a strong balance. Our key findings include: (1) the design of the subject image encoder significantly impacts identity preservation quality, and (2) generating an initial layout is crucial for both text alignment and identity preservation. Building on these insights, we introduce a new approach called EZIGen, which employs two main strategies: a carefully crafted subject image Encoder based on the UNet architecture of the pretrained Stable Diffusion model to ensure high-quality identity transfer, following a process that decouples the guidance stages and iteratively refines the initial image layout. Through these strategies, EZIGen achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple subject-driven benchmarks with a unified model and 100 times less training data."
"Securing Large Language Models: Addressing Bias, Misinformation, and Prompt Attacks","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across various fields, yet their increasing use raises critical security concerns. This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field."
"Linear energy storage and flexibility model with ramp rate, ramping, deadline and capacity constraints","The power networks are evolving with increased active components such as energy storage and flexibility derived from loads such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, industrial processes, etc. Better models are needed to accurately represent these assets; otherwise, their true capabilities might be over or under-estimated. In this work, we propose a new energy storage and flexibility arbitrage model that accounts for both ramp (power) and capacity (energy) limits, while accurately modelling the ramp rate constraint. The proposed models are linear in structure and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf solvers as a linear programming problem. We also provide an online repository for wider application and benchmarking. Finally, numerical case studies are performed to quantify the sensitivity of ramp rate constraint on the operational goal of profit maximization for energy storage and flexibility. The results are encouraging for assets with a slow ramp rate limit. We observe that for resources with a ramp rate limit of 10% of the maximum ramp limit, the marginal value of performing energy arbitrage using such resources exceeds 65% and up to 90% of the maximum profit compared to the case with no ramp rate limitations."
SimMAT: Exploring Transferability from Vision Foundation Models to Any Image Modality,"Foundation models like ChatGPT and Sora that are trained on a huge scale of data have made a revolutionary social impact. However, it is extremely challenging for sensors in many different fields to collect similar scales of natural images to train strong foundation models. To this end, this work presents a simple and effective framework SimMAT to study an open problem: the transferability from vision foundation models trained on natural RGB images to other image modalities of different physical properties (e.g., polarization). SimMAT consists of a modality-agnostic transfer layer (MAT) and a pretrained foundation model. We apply SimMAT to a representative vision foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM) to support any evaluated new image modality. Given the absence of relevant benchmarks, we construct a new benchmark to evaluate the transfer learning performance. Our experiments confirm the intriguing potential of transferring vision foundation models in enhancing other sensors' performance. Specifically, SimMAT can improve the segmentation performance (mIoU) from 22.15% to 53.88% on average for evaluated modalities and consistently outperforms other baselines. We hope that SimMAT can raise awareness of cross-modal transfer learning and benefit various fields for better results with vision foundation models."
SoVAR: Building Generalizable Scenarios from Accident Reports for Autonomous Driving Testing,"Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) have undergone remarkable development and are increasingly employed in safety-critical applications. However, recently reported data on fatal accidents involving ADSs suggests that the desired level of safety has not yet been fully achieved. Consequently, there is a growing need for more comprehensive and targeted testing approaches to ensure safe driving. Scenarios from real-world accident reports provide valuable resources for ADS testing, including critical scenarios and high-quality seeds. However, existing scenario reconstruction methods from accident reports often exhibit limited accuracy in information extraction. Moreover, due to the diversity and complexity of road environments, matching current accident information with the simulation map data for reconstruction poses significant challenges. In this paper, we design and implement SoVAR, a tool for automatically generating road-generalizable scenarios from accident reports. SoVAR utilizes well-designed prompts with linguistic patterns to guide the large language model in extracting accident information from textual data. Subsequently, it formulates and solves accident-related constraints in conjunction with the extracted accident information to generate accident trajectories. Finally, SoVAR reconstructs accident scenarios on various map structures and converts them into test scenarios to evaluate its capability to detect defects in industrial ADSs. We experiment with SoVAR, using accident reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's database to generate test scenarios for the industrial-grade ADS Apollo. The experimental findings demonstrate that SoVAR can effectively generate generalized accident scenarios across different road structures. Furthermore, the results confirm that SoVAR identified 5 distinct safety violation types that contributed to the crash of Baidu Apollo."
MosquitoMiner: A Light Weight Rover for Detecting and Eliminating Mosquito Breeding Sites,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to the development and deployment of an autonomous mosquito breeding place detector rover with the object and obstacle detection capabilities to control mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose significant health threats globally, with conventional control methods proving slow and inefficient. Amidst rising concerns over the rapid spread of these diseases, there is an urgent need for innovative and efficient strategies to manage mosquito populations and prevent disease transmission. To mitigate the limitations of manual labor and traditional methods, our rover employs autonomous control strategies. Leveraging our own custom dataset, the rover can autonomously navigate along a pre-defined path, identifying and mitigating potential breeding grounds with precision. It then proceeds to eliminate these breeding grounds by spraying a chemical agent, effectively eradicating mosquito habitats. Our project demonstrates the effectiveness that is absent in traditional ways of controlling and safeguarding public health. The code for this project is available on GitHub at - https://github.com/faiyazabdullah/MosquitoMiner"
Diffusion-Based Image-to-Image Translation by Noise Correction via Prompt Interpolation,"We propose a simple but effective training-free approach tailored to diffusion-based image-to-image translation. Our approach revises the original noise prediction network of a pretrained diffusion model by introducing a noise correction term. We formulate the noise correction term as the difference between two noise predictions; one is computed from the denoising network with a progressive interpolation of the source and target prompt embeddings, while the other is the noise prediction with the source prompt embedding. The final noise prediction network is given by a linear combination of the standard denoising term and the noise correction term, where the former is designed to reconstruct must-be-preserved regions while the latter aims to effectively edit regions of interest relevant to the target prompt. Our approach can be easily incorporated into existing image-to-image translation methods based on diffusion models. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed technique achieves outstanding performance with low latency and consistently improves existing frameworks when combined with them."
Computational Algorithms for the Product Form Solution of Closed Queuing Networks with Finite Buffers and Skip-Over Policy,"Closed queuing networks with finite capacity buffers and skip-over policies are fundamental models in the performance evaluation of computer and communication systems. This technical report presents the details of computational algorithms to derive the key performance metrics for such networks. The primary focus is on the efficient computation of the normalization constant, which is critical for determining the steady-state probabilities of the network states under investigation. A convolution algorithm is proposed, which paves the way for the computation of key performance indices, such as queue length distribution and throughput, accommodating the intricacies introduced by finite capacity constraints and skip-over mechanisms. Finally, an extension of the traditional Mean Value Analysis algorithm addressing numerical stability is provided. The approaches discussed here allow make the investigation of large-scale networks feasible and enable the development of robust implementations of these techniques for practical use."
TravelAgent: An AI Assistant for Personalized Travel Planning,"As global tourism expands and artificial intelligence technology advances, intelligent travel planning services have emerged as a significant research focus. Within dynamic real-world travel scenarios with multi-dimensional constraints, services that support users in automatically creating practical and customized travel itineraries must address three key objectives: Rationality, Comprehensiveness, and Personalization. However, existing systems with rule-based combinations or LLM-based planning methods struggle to fully satisfy these criteria. To overcome the challenges, we introduce TravelAgent, a travel planning system powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to provide reasonable, comprehensive, and personalized travel itineraries grounded in dynamic scenarios. TravelAgent comprises four modules: Tool-usage, Recommendation, Planning, and Memory Module. We evaluate TravelAgent's performance with human and simulated users, demonstrating its overall effectiveness in three criteria and confirming the accuracy of personalized recommendations."
AutoPET Challenge: Tumour Synthesis for Data Augmentation,"Accurate lesion segmentation in whole-body PET/CT scans is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment planning, but limited datasets often hinder the performance of automated segmentation models. In this paper, we explore the potential of leveraging the deep prior from a generative model to serve as a data augmenter for automated lesion segmentation in PET/CT scans. We adapt the DiffTumor method, originally designed for CT images, to generate synthetic PET-CT images with lesions. Our approach trains the generative model on the AutoPET dataset and uses it to expand the training data. We then compare the performance of segmentation models trained on the original and augmented datasets. Our findings show that the model trained on the augmented dataset achieves a higher Dice score, demonstrating the potential of our data augmentation approach. In a nutshell, this work presents a promising direction for improving lesion segmentation in whole-body PET/CT scans with limited datasets, potentially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of cancer diagnostics."
Self-Supervised Learning of Iterative Solvers for Constrained Optimization,"Obtaining the solution of constrained optimization problems as a function of parameters is very important in a multitude of applications, such as control and planning. Solving such parametric optimization problems in real time can present significant challenges, particularly when it is necessary to obtain highly accurate solutions or batches of solutions. To solve these challenges, we propose a learning-based iterative solver for constrained optimization which can obtain very fast and accurate solutions by customizing the solver to a specific parametric optimization problem. For a given set of parameters of the constrained optimization problem, we propose a first step with a neural network predictor that outputs primal-dual solutions of a reasonable degree of accuracy. This primal-dual solution is then improved to a very high degree of accuracy in a second step by a learned iterative solver in the form of a neural network. A novel loss function based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of optimality is introduced, enabling fully self-supervised training of both neural networks without the necessity of prior sampling of optimizer solutions. The evaluation of a variety of quadratic and nonlinear parametric test problems demonstrates that the predictor alone is already competitive with recent self-supervised schemes for approximating optimal solutions. The second step of our proposed learning-based iterative constrained optimizer achieves solutions with orders of magnitude better accuracy than other learning-based approaches, while being faster to evaluate than state-of-the-art solvers and natively allowing for GPU parallelization."
AI-accelerated discovery of high critical temperature superconductors,"The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ and B$_5$CN$_2$ whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties."
Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs,"This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems."
Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer for Offline Reinforcement Learning,"As a data-driven paradigm, offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) has been formulated as sequence modeling, where the Decision Transformer (DT) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities. Unlike previous reinforcement learning methods that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, DT adjusts the autoregressive model based on the expected returns, past states, and actions, using a causally masked Transformer to output the optimal action. However, due to the inconsistency between the sampled returns within a single trajectory and the optimal returns across multiple trajectories, it is challenging to set an expected return to output the optimal action and stitch together suboptimal trajectories. Decision ConvFormer (DC) is easier to understand in the context of modeling RL trajectories within a Markov Decision Process compared to DT. We propose the Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer (QDC), which combines the understanding of RL trajectories by DC and incorporates a term that maximizes action values using dynamic programming methods during training. This ensures that the expected returns of the sampled actions are consistent with the optimal returns. QDC achieves excellent performance on the D4RL benchmark, outperforming or approaching the optimal level in all tested environments. It particularly demonstrates outstanding competitiveness in trajectory stitching capability."
Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications,"Biosignal acquisition is key for healthcare applications and wearable devices, with machine learning offering promising methods for processing signals like surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be prepended to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperform standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study shows that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements, in line with sEMG physiological expectations."
Expansive Supervision for Neural Radiance Field,"Neural Radiance Fields have achieved success in creating powerful 3D media representations with their exceptional reconstruction capabilities. However, the computational demands of volume rendering pose significant challenges during model training. Existing acceleration techniques often involve redesigning the model architecture, leading to limitations in compatibility across different frameworks. Furthermore, these methods tend to overlook the substantial memory costs incurred. In response to these challenges, we introduce an expansive supervision mechanism that efficiently balances computational load, rendering quality and flexibility for neural radiance field training. This mechanism operates by selectively rendering a small but crucial subset of pixels and expanding their values to estimate the error across the entire area for each iteration. Compare to conventional supervision, our method effectively bypasses redundant rendering processes, resulting in notable reductions in both time and memory consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating expansive supervision within existing state-of-the-art acceleration frameworks can achieve 69% memory savings and 42% time savings, with negligible compromise in visual quality."
Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity learning in a planar magnetic domain wall artificial synapsis,"Future neuromorphic architectures will require millions of artificial synapses, making understanding the physical mechanisms behind their plasticity functionalities mandatory. In this work, we propose a simplified spin memristor, where the resistance can be controlled by magnetic field pulses, based on a Co/Pt multilayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as a synapsis emulator. We demonstrate plasticity and spike time dependence plasticity (STDP) in this device and explored the underlying magnetic mechanisms using Kerr microscopy imaging and Hall magneto-transport measurements. A well-defined threshold for magnetization reversal and the continuous resistance states associated with the micromagnetic configuration are the basic properties allowing plasticity and STDP learning mechanisms in this device."
Predicting and Accelerating Nanomaterials Synthesis Using Machine Learning Featurization,"Solving for the complex conditions of materials synthesis and processing requires analyzing information gathered from multiple modes of characterization. Currently, quantitative information is extracted serially with manual tools and intuition, constraining the feedback cycle for process optimization. We use machine learning to automate and generalize feature extraction for in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) data to establish quantitatively predictive relationships in small sets ($\sim$10) of expert-labeled data, and apply these to save significant time on subsequent epitaxially grown samples. The fidelity of these relationships is tested on a representative material system ($W_{1-x}V_xSe2$ growth on c-plane sapphire substrate (0001)) at two stages of synthesis with two aims: 1) predicting the grain alignment of the deposited film from the pre-growth substrate surface data, and 2) estimating the vanadium (V) dopant concentration using in-situ RHEED as a proxy for ex-situ methods (e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Both tasks are accomplished using the same set of materials agnostic core features, eliminating the need to retrain for specific systems and leading to a potential 80\% time saving over a 100 sample synthesis campaign. These predictions provide guidance for recipe adjustments to avoid doomed trials, reduce follow-on characterization, and improve control resolution for materials synthesis, ultimately accelerating materials discovery and commercial scale-up."
On the challenges of studying bias in Recommender Systems: A UserKNN case study,"Statements on the propagation of bias by recommender systems are often hard to verify or falsify. Research on bias tends to draw from a small pool of publicly available datasets and is therefore bound by their specific properties. Additionally, implementation choices are often not explicitly described or motivated in research, while they may have an effect on bias propagation. In this paper, we explore the challenges of measuring and reporting popularity bias. We showcase the impact of data properties and algorithm configurations on popularity bias by combining synthetic data with well known recommender systems frameworks that implement UserKNN. First, we identify data characteristics that might impact popularity bias, based on the functionality of UserKNN. Accordingly, we generate various datasets that combine these characteristics. Second, we locate UserKNN configurations that vary across implementations in literature. We evaluate popularity bias for five synthetic datasets and five UserKNN configurations, and offer insights on their joint effect. We find that, depending on the data characteristics, various UserKNN configurations can lead to different conclusions regarding the propagation of popularity bias. These results motivate the need for explicitly addressing algorithmic configuration and data properties when reporting and interpreting bias in recommender systems."
Unleashing Worms and Extracting Data: Escalating the Outcome of Attacks against RAG-based Inference in Scale and Severity Using Jailbreaking,"In this paper, we show that with the ability to jailbreak a GenAI model, attackers can escalate the outcome of attacks against RAG-based GenAI-powered applications in severity and scale. In the first part of the paper, we show that attackers can escalate RAG membership inference attacks and RAG entity extraction attacks to RAG documents extraction attacks, forcing a more severe outcome compared to existing attacks. We evaluate the results obtained from three extraction methods, the influence of the type and the size of five embeddings algorithms employed, the size of the provided context, and the GenAI engine. We show that attackers can extract 80%-99.8% of the data stored in the database used by the RAG of a Q&A chatbot. In the second part of the paper, we show that attackers can escalate the scale of RAG data poisoning attacks from compromising a single GenAI-powered application to compromising the entire GenAI ecosystem, forcing a greater scale of damage. This is done by crafting an adversarial self-replicating prompt that triggers a chain reaction of a computer worm within the ecosystem and forces each affected application to perform a malicious activity and compromise the RAG of additional applications. We evaluate the performance of the worm in creating a chain of confidential data extraction about users within a GenAI ecosystem of GenAI-powered email assistants and analyze how the performance of the worm is affected by the size of the context, the adversarial self-replicating prompt used, the type and size of the embeddings algorithm employed, and the number of hops in the propagation. Finally, we review and analyze guardrails to protect RAG-based inference and discuss the tradeoffs."
External Memories of PDP Switches for In-Network Implementable Functions Placement: Deep Learning Based Reconfiguration of SFCs,"Network function virtualization leverages programmable data plane switches to deploy in-network implementable functions, to improve QoS. The memories of switches can be extended through remote direct memory access to access external memories. This paper exploits the switches external memories to place VNFs at time intervals with ultra-low latency and high bandwidth demands. The reconfiguration decision is modeled as an optimization to minimize the deployment and reconfiguration cost, while meeting the SFCs deadlines. A DRL based method is proposed to reconfigure service chains adoptable with dynamic network and traffic characteristics. To deal with slow convergence due to the complexity of deployment scenarios, static and dynamic filters are used in policy networks construction to diminish unfeasible placement exploration. Results illustrate improvement in convergence, acceptance ratio and cost."
Thermal3D-GS: Physics-induced 3D Gaussians for Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis,"Novel-view synthesis based on visible light has been extensively studied. In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method. Our dataset and codebase will be released in \href{https://github.com/mzzcdf/Thermal3DGS}{\textcolor{red}{Thermal3DGS}}."
Interaction graphs of isomorphic automata networks II: universal dynamics,"An automata network with $n$ components over a finite alphabet $Q$ of size $q$ is a discrete dynamical system described by the successive iterations of a function $f:Q^n\to Q^n$. In most applications, the main parameter is the interaction graph of $f$: the digraph with vertex set $[n]$ that contains an arc from $j$ to $i$ if $f_i$ depends on input $j$. What can be said on the set $\mathbb{G}(f)$ of the interaction graphs of the automata networks isomorphic to $f$? It seems that this simple question has never been studied. In a previous paper, we prove that the complete digraph $K_n$, with $n^2$ arcs, is universal in that $K_n\in \mathbb{G}(f)$ whenever $f$ is not constant nor the identity (and $n\geq 5$). In this paper, taking the opposite direction, we prove that there exists universal automata networks $f$, in that $\mathbb{G}(f)$ contains all the digraphs on $[n]$, excepted the empty one. Actually, we prove that the presence of only three specific digraphs in $\mathbb{G}(f)$ implies the universality of $f$, and we prove that this forces the alphabet size $q$ to have at least $n$ prime factors (with multiplicity). However, we prove that for any fixed $q\geq 3$, there exists almost universal functions, that is, functions $f:Q^n\to Q^n$ such that the probability that a random digraph belongs to $\mathbb{G}(f)$ tends to $1$ as $n\to\infty$. We do not know if this holds in the binary case $q=2$, providing only partial results."
Zero-Shot Sing Voice Conversion: built upon clustering-based phoneme representations,"This study presents an innovative Zero-Shot any-to-any Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) method, leveraging a novel clustering-based phoneme representation to effectively separate content, timbre, and singing style. This approach enables precise voice characteristic manipulation. We discovered that datasets with fewer recordings per artist are more susceptible to timbre leakage. Extensive testing on over 10,000 hours of singing and user feedback revealed our model significantly improves sound quality and timbre accuracy, aligning with our objectives and advancing voice conversion technology. Furthermore, this research advances zero-shot SVC and sets the stage for future work on discrete speech representation, emphasizing the preservation of rhyme."
Fine-Grained Complexity of Multiple Domination and Dominating Patterns in Sparse Graphs,"The study of domination in graphs has led to a variety of domination problems studied in the literature. Most of these follow the following general framework: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide if there is a set $S$ of $k$ vertices such that (1) some inner property $\phi(S)$ (e.g., connectedness) is satisfied, and (2) each vertex $v$ satisfies some domination property $\rho(S, v)$ (e.g., there is an $s\in S$ that is adjacent to $v$).   Since many real-world graphs are sparse, we seek to determine the optimal running time of such problems in both the number $n$ of vertices and the number $m$ of edges in $G$. While the classic dominating set problem admits a rather limited improvement in sparse graphs (Fischer, K\""unnemann, Redzic SODA'24), we show that natural variants studied in the literature admit much larger speed-ups, with a diverse set of possible running times. Specifically, we obtain conditionally optimal algorithms for:   1) $r$-Multiple $k$-Dominating Set (each vertex must be adjacent to at least $r$ vertices in $S$): If $r\le k-2$, we obtain a running time of $(m/n)^{r} n^{k-r+o(1)}$ that is conditionally optimal assuming the 3-uniform hyperclique hypothesis. In sparse graphs, this fully interpolates between $n^{k-1\pm o(1)}$ and $n^{2\pm o(1)}$, depending on $r$. Curiously, when $r=k-1$, we obtain a randomized algorithm beating $(m/n)^{k-1} n^{1+o(1)}$ and we show that this algorithm is close to optimal under the $k$-clique hypothesis.   2) $H$-Dominating Set ($S$ must induce a pattern $H$). We conditionally settle the complexity of three such problems: (a) Dominating Clique ($H$ is a $k$-clique), (b) Maximal Independent Set of size $k$ ($H$ is an independent set on $k$ vertices), (c) Dominating Induced Matching ($H$ is a perfect matching on $k$ vertices)."
Heterogeneous Sheaf Neural Networks,"Heterogeneous graphs, with nodes and edges of different types, are commonly used to model relational structures in many real-world applications. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle to process heterogeneous data due to oversmoothing. Instead, current approaches have focused on accounting for the heterogeneity in the model architecture, leading to increasingly complex models. Inspired by recent work, we propose using cellular sheaves to model the heterogeneity in the graph's underlying topology. Instead of modelling the data as a graph, we represent it as cellular sheaves, which allows us to encode the different data types directly in the data structure, eliminating the need to inject them into the architecture. We introduce HetSheaf, a general framework for heterogeneous sheaf neural networks, and a series of heterogeneous sheaf predictors to better encode the data's heterogeneity into the sheaf structure. Finally, we empirically evaluate HetSheaf on several standard heterogeneous graph benchmarks, achieving competitive results whilst being more parameter-efficient."
A three-dimensional force estimation method for the cable-driven soft robot based on monocular images,"Soft manipulators are known for their superiority in coping with high-safety-demanding interaction tasks, e.g., robot-assisted surgeries, elderly caring, etc. Yet the challenges residing in real-time contact feedback have hindered further applications in precise manipulation. This paper proposes an end-to-end network to estimate the 3D contact force of the soft robot, with the aim of enhancing its capabilities in interactive tasks. The presented method features directly utilizing monocular images fused with multidimensional actuation information as the network inputs. This approach simplifies the preprocessing of raw data compared to related studies that utilize 3D shape information for network inputs, consequently reducing configuration reconstruction errors. The unified feature representation module is devised to elevate low-dimensional features from the system's actuation signals to the same level as image features, facilitating smoother integration of multimodal information. The proposed method has been experimentally validated in the soft robot testbed, achieving satisfying accuracy in 3D force estimation (with a mean relative error of 0.84% compared to the best-reported result of 2.2% in the related works)."
LED: Light Enhanced Depth Estimation at Night,"Nighttime camera-based depth estimation is a highly challenging task, especially for autonomous driving applications, where accurate depth perception is essential for ensuring safe navigation. We aim to improve the reliability of perception systems at night time, where models trained on daytime data often fail in the absence of precise but costly LiDAR sensors. In this work, we introduce Light Enhanced Depth (LED), a novel cost-effective approach that significantly improves depth estimation in low-light environments by harnessing a pattern projected by high definition headlights available in modern vehicles. LED leads to significant performance boosts across multiple depth-estimation architectures (encoder-decoder, Adabins, DepthFormer) both on synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, increased performances beyond illuminated areas reveal a holistic enhancement in scene understanding. Finally, we release the Nighttime Synthetic Drive Dataset, a new synthetic and photo-realistic nighttime dataset, which comprises 49,990 comprehensively annotated images."
"From Explanations to Action: A Zero-Shot, Theory-Driven LLM Framework for Student Performance Feedback","Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields."
Scribble-Guided Diffusion for Training-free Text-to-Image Generation,"Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success, yet they often struggle to fully capture the user's intent. Existing approaches using textual inputs combined with bounding boxes or region masks fall short in providing precise spatial guidance, often leading to misaligned or unintended object orientation. To address these limitations, we propose Scribble-Guided Diffusion (ScribbleDiff), a training-free approach that utilizes simple user-provided scribbles as visual prompts to guide image generation. However, incorporating scribbles into diffusion models presents challenges due to their sparse and thin nature, making it difficult to ensure accurate orientation alignment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce moment alignment and scribble propagation, which allow for more effective and flexible alignment between generated images and scribble inputs. Experimental results on the PASCAL-Scribble dataset demonstrate significant improvements in spatial control and consistency, showcasing the effectiveness of scribble-based guidance in diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/kaist-cvml-lab/scribble-diffusion."
Alternating hierarchy of sushifts defined by nondeterministic plane-walking automata,"Plane-walking automata were introduced by Salo & T\""orma to recognise languages of two-dimensional infinite words (subshifts), the counterpart of $4$-way finite automata for two-dimensional finite words. We extend the model to allow for nondeterminism and alternation of quantifiers. We prove that the recognised subshifts form a strict subclass of sofic subshifts, and that the classes corresponding to existential and universal nondeterminism are incomparable and both larger that the deterministic class. We define a hierarchy of subshifts recognised by plane-walking automata with alternating quantifiers, which we conjecture to be strict."
Edge-Wise Graph-Instructed Neural Networks,"The problem of multi-task regression over graph nodes has been recently approached through Graph-Instructed Neural Network (GINN), which is a promising architecture belonging to the subset of message-passing graph neural networks. In this work, we discuss the limitations of the Graph-Instructed (GI) layer, and we formalize a novel edge-wise GI (EWGI) layer. We discuss the advantages of the EWGI layer and we provide numerical evidence that EWGINNs perform better than GINNs over graph-structured input data with chaotic connectivity, like the ones inferred from the Erdos-R\'enyi graph."
Network Anomaly Traffic Detection via Multi-view Feature Fusion,"Traditional anomalous traffic detection methods are based on single-view analysis, which has obvious limitations in dealing with complex attacks and encrypted communications. In this regard, we propose a Multi-view Feature Fusion (MuFF) method for network anomaly traffic detection. MuFF models the temporal and interactive relationships of packets in network traffic based on the temporal and interactive viewpoints respectively. It learns temporal and interactive features. These features are then fused from different perspectives for anomaly traffic detection. Extensive experiments on six real traffic datasets show that MuFF has excellent performance in network anomalous traffic detection, which makes up for the shortcomings of detection under a single perspective."
An Evaluation Framework for Attributed Information Retrieval using Large Language Models,"With the growing success of Large Language models (LLMs) in information-seeking scenarios, search engines are now adopting generative approaches to provide answers along with in-line citations as attribution. While existing work focuses mainly on attributed question answering, in this paper, we target information-seeking scenarios which are often more challenging due to the open-ended nature of the queries and the size of the label space in terms of the diversity of candidate-attributed answers per query. We propose a reproducible framework to evaluate and benchmark attributed information seeking, using any backbone LLM, and different architectural designs: (1) Generate (2) Retrieve then Generate, and (3) Generate then Retrieve. Experiments using HAGRID, an attributed information-seeking dataset, show the impact of different scenarios on both the correctness and attributability of answers."
DPconv: Super-Polynomially Faster Join Ordering,"We revisit the join ordering problem in query optimization. The standard exact algorithm, DPccp, has a worst-case running time of $O(3^n)$. This is prohibitively expensive for large queries, which are not that uncommon anymore. We develop a new algorithmic framework based on subset convolution. DPconv achieves a super-polynomial speedup over DPccp, breaking the $O(3^n)$ time-barrier for the first time. We show that the instantiation of our framework for the $C_\max$ cost function is up to 30x faster than DPccp for large clique queries."
Learning Causally Invariant Reward Functions from Diverse Demonstrations,"Inverse reinforcement learning methods aim to retrieve the reward function of a Markov decision process based on a dataset of expert demonstrations. The commonplace scarcity and heterogeneous sources of such demonstrations can lead to the absorption of spurious correlations in the data by the learned reward function. Consequently, this adaptation often exhibits behavioural overfitting to the expert data set when a policy is trained on the obtained reward function under distribution shift of the environment dynamics. In this work, we explore a novel regularization approach for inverse reinforcement learning methods based on the causal invariance principle with the goal of improved reward function generalization. By applying this regularization to both exact and approximate formulations of the learning task, we demonstrate superior policy performance when trained using the recovered reward functions in a transfer setting"
Multiplex Graph Contrastive Learning with Soft Negatives,"Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) seeks to learn nodal or graph representations that contain maximal consistent information from graph-structured data. While node-level contrasting modes are dominating, some efforts commence to explore consistency across different scales. Yet, they tend to lose consistent information and be contaminated by disturbing features. Here, we introduce MUX-GCL, a novel cross-scale contrastive learning paradigm that utilizes multiplex representations as effective patches. While this learning mode minimizes contaminating noises, a commensurate contrasting strategy using positional affinities further avoids information loss by correcting false negative pairs across scales. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate that MUX-GCL yields multiple state-of-the-art results on public datasets. Our theoretical analysis further guarantees the new objective function as a stricter lower bound of mutual information of raw input features and output embeddings, which rationalizes this paradigm. Code is available at https://github.com/MUX-GCL/Code."
Towards regulatory compliant lifecycle for AI-based medical devices in EU: Industry perspectives,"Despite the immense potential of AI-powered medical devices to revolutionize healthcare, concerns regarding their safety in life-critical applications remain. While the European regulatory framework provides a comprehensive approach to medical device software development, it falls short in addressing AI-specific considerations. This article proposes a model to bridge this gap by extending the general idea of AI lifecycle with regulatory activities relevant to AI-enabled medical systems."
Learning Communities from Equilibria of Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics,"This paper studies community detection for a nonlinear opinion dynamics model from its equilibria. It is assumed that the underlying network is generated from a stochastic block model with two communities, where agents are assigned with community labels and edges are added independently based on these labels. Agents update their opinions following a nonlinear rule that incorporates saturation effects on interactions. It is shown that clustering based on a single equilibrium can detect most community labels (i.e., achieving almost exact recovery), if the two communities differ in size and link probabilities. When the two communities are identical in size and link probabilities, and the inter-community connections are denser than intra-community ones, the algorithm can achieve almost exact recovery under negative influence weights but fails under positive influence weights. Utilizing fixed point equations and spectral methods, we also propose a detection algorithm based on multiple equilibria, which can detect communities with positive influence weights. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms."
OCTAMamba: A State-Space Model Approach for Precision OCTA Vasculature Segmentation,"Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a crucial imaging technique for visualizing retinal vasculature and diagnosing eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. However, precise segmentation of OCTA vasculature remains challenging due to the multi-scale vessel structures and noise from poor image quality and eye lesions. In this study, we proposed OCTAMamba, a novel U-shaped network based on the Mamba architecture, designed to segment vasculature in OCTA accurately. OCTAMamba integrates a Quad Stream Efficient Mining Embedding Module for local feature extraction, a Multi-Scale Dilated Asymmetric Convolution Module to capture multi-scale vasculature, and a Focused Feature Recalibration Module to filter noise and highlight target areas. Our method achieves efficient global modeling and local feature extraction while maintaining linear complexity, making it suitable for low-computation medical applications. Extensive experiments on the OCTA 3M, OCTA 6M, and ROSSA datasets demonstrated that OCTAMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a new reference for efficient OCTA segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/zs1314/OCTAMamba"
Privacy-preserving federated prediction of pain intensity change based on multi-center survey data,"Background: Patient-reported survey data are used to train prognostic models aimed at improving healthcare. However, such data are typically available multi-centric and, for privacy reasons, cannot easily be centralized in one data repository. Models trained locally are less accurate, robust, and generalizable. We present and apply privacy-preserving federated machine learning techniques for prognostic model building, where local survey data never leaves the legally safe harbors of the medical centers. Methods: We used centralized, local, and federated learning techniques on two healthcare datasets (GLA:D data from the five health regions of Denmark and international SHARE data of 27 countries) to predict two different health outcomes. We compared linear regression, random forest regression, and random forest classification models trained on local data with those trained on the entire data in a centralized and in a federated fashion. Results: In GLA:D data, federated linear regression (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.2) and federated random forest regression (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.3) models outperform their local counterparts (i.e., R2 0.32, RMSE 18.6, R2 0.30, RMSE 18.8) with statistical significance. We also found that centralized models (R2 0.34, RMSE 18.2, R2 0.32, RMSE 18.5, respectively) did not perform significantly better than the federated models. In SHARE, the federated model (AC 0.78, AUROC: 0.71) and centralized model (AC 0.84, AUROC: 0.66) perform significantly better than the local models (AC: 0.74, AUROC: 0.69). Conclusion: Federated learning enables the training of prognostic models from multi-center surveys without compromising privacy and with only minimal or no compromise regarding model performance."
A SUBSET-SUM Characterisation of the A-Hierarchy,The A-hierarchy is a parametric analogue of the polynomial hierarchy in the context of paramterised complexity theory. We give a new characterisation of the A-hierarchy in terms of a generalisation of the SUBSET-SUM problem.
Depth Matters: Exploring Deep Interactions of RGB-D for Semantic Segmentation in Traffic Scenes,"RGB-D has gradually become a crucial data source for understanding complex scenes in assisted driving. However, existing studies have paid insufficient attention to the intrinsic spatial properties of depth maps. This oversight significantly impacts the attention representation, leading to prediction errors caused by attention shift issues. To this end, we propose a novel learnable Depth interaction Pyramid Transformer (DiPFormer) to explore the effectiveness of depth. Firstly, we introduce Depth Spatial-Aware Optimization (Depth SAO) as offset to represent real-world spatial relationships. Secondly, the similarity in the feature space of RGB-D is learned by Depth Linear Cross-Attention (Depth LCA) to clarify spatial differences at the pixel level. Finally, an MLP Decoder is utilized to effectively fuse multi-scale features for meeting real-time requirements. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DiPFormer significantly addresses the issue of attention misalignment in both road detection (+7.5%) and semantic segmentation (+4.9% / +1.5%) tasks. DiPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI (97.57% F-score on KITTI road and 68.74% mIoU on KITTI-360) and Cityscapes (83.4% mIoU) datasets."
Directional WPT Charging for Routing-Asymmetric WRSNs with a Mobile Charger,"Mobile Charge Scheduling for wirelessly charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) is a promising but still evolving research area. Existing research mostly assumes a symmetric environment, where the routing costs in opposite directions between two locations are considered identical. However, various factors such as terrain restrictions and wind or water flows may invalidate the routing-symmetric assumption in practical environments, thereby significantly limiting the performance of these solutions in routing-asymmetric WRSNs (RA-WRSNs). To address the routing-asymmetric challenges in mobile charge scheduling for WRSNs, this paper systematically investigates the underlying Asymmetric Directional Mobile Charger (DMC) Charge Scheduling (ADMCCS) problem, aiming to minimize energy loss while satisfying the charging demands of the network nodes. The DMC model is assumed because its results can be easily applied to the specialized case of an Omnidirectional Mobile Charger (OMC). To solve the ADMCCS problem, we propose a four-step framework. First, a minimum-size efficient charging position set is selected using our designed K-means-based Charging Position Generation (KCPG) algorithm, addressing the challenge of the unlimited charging position selection space. Next, minimum-size functional-equivalent direction sets at these positions are determined using an optimal algorithm, tackling the challenge of infinite charging directions. Subsequently, the optimal energy transmission time lengths for all directions at the positions are obtained by formulating and solving a Nonlinear Program (NLP) problem. Finally, the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic (LKH) algorithm for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem is adapted to obtain a highly probable optimal loop tour, addressing the routing-asymmetric challenge."
Enhancing Few-Shot Image Classification through Learnable Multi-Scale Embedding and Attention Mechanisms,"In the context of few-shot classification, the goal is to train a classifier using a limited number of samples while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, traditional metric-based methods exhibit certain limitations in achieving this objective. These methods typically rely on a single distance value between the query feature and support feature, thereby overlooking the contribution of shallow features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper. Our approach involves utilizing multi-output embedding network that maps samples into distinct feature spaces. The proposed method extract feature vectors at different stages, enabling the model to capture both global and abstract features. By utilizing these diverse feature spaces, our model enhances its performance. Moreover, employing a self-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage, leading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance. Furthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved performance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the MiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed a cross-domain task from MiniImageNet to the CUB dataset, achieving high accuracy in the testing domain. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet"
Games for AI Control: Models of Safety Evaluations of AI Deployment Protocols,"To evaluate the safety and usefulness of deployment protocols for untrusted AIs, AI Control uses a red-teaming exercise played between a protocol designer and an adversary. This paper introduces AI-Control Games, a formal decision-making model of the red-teaming exercise as a multi-objective, partially observable, stochastic game. We also introduce methods for finding optimal protocols in AI-Control Games, by reducing them to a set of zero-sum partially observable stochastic games. We apply our formalism to model, evaluate and synthesise protocols for deploying untrusted language models as programming assistants, focusing on Trusted Monitoring protocols, which use weaker language models and limited human assistance. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formalism by showcasing improvements over empirical studies in existing settings, evaluating protocols in new settings, and analysing how modelling assumptions affect the safety and usefulness of protocols."
SPARK: Self-supervised Personalized Real-time Monocular Face Capture,"Feedforward monocular face capture methods seek to reconstruct posed faces from a single image of a person. Current state of the art approaches have the ability to regress parametric 3D face models in real-time across a wide range of identities, lighting conditions and poses by leveraging large image datasets of human faces. These methods however suffer from clear limitations in that the underlying parametric face model only provides a coarse estimation of the face shape, thereby limiting their practical applicability in tasks that require precise 3D reconstruction (aging, face swapping, digital make-up, ...). In this paper, we propose a method for high-precision 3D face capture taking advantage of a collection of unconstrained videos of a subject as prior information. Our proposal builds on a two stage approach. We start with the reconstruction of a detailed 3D face avatar of the person, capturing both precise geometry and appearance from a collection of videos. We then use the encoder from a pre-trained monocular face reconstruction method, substituting its decoder with our personalized model, and proceed with transfer learning on the video collection. Using our pre-estimated image formation model, we obtain a more precise self-supervision objective, enabling improved expression and pose alignment. This results in a trained encoder capable of efficiently regressing pose and expression parameters in real-time from previously unseen images, which combined with our personalized geometry model yields more accurate and high fidelity mesh inference. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we showcase the superiority of our final model as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and demonstrate its generalization ability to unseen pose, expression and lighting."
Sparse R-CNN OBB: Ship Target Detection in SAR Images Based on Oriented Sparse Proposals,"We present Sparse R-CNN OBB, a novel framework for the detection of oriented objects in SAR images leveraging sparse learnable proposals. The Sparse R-CNN OBB has streamlined architecture and ease of training as it utilizes a sparse set of 300 proposals instead of training a proposals generator on hundreds of thousands of anchors. To the best of our knowledge, Sparse R-CNN OBB is the first to adopt the concept of sparse learnable proposals for the detection of oriented objects, as well as for the detection of ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The detection head of the baseline model, Sparse R-CNN, is re-designed to enable the model to capture object orientation. We also fine-tune the model on RSDD-SAR dataset and provide a performance comparison to state-of-the-art models. Experimental results shows that Sparse R-CNN OBB achieves outstanding performance, surpassing other models on both inshore and offshore scenarios. The code is available at: www.github.com/ka-mirul/Sparse-R-CNN-OBB."
Deep Height Decoupling for Precise Vision-based 3D Occupancy Prediction,"The task of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct 3D geometry and estimate its semantic classes from 2D color images, where the 2D-to-3D view transformation is an indispensable step. Most previous methods conduct forward projection, such as BEVPooling and VoxelPooling, both of which map the 2D image features into 3D grids. However, the current grid representing features within a certain height range usually introduces many confusing features that belong to other height ranges. To address this challenge, we present Deep Height Decoupling (DHD), a novel framework that incorporates explicit height prior to filter out the confusing features. Specifically, DHD first predicts height maps via explicit supervision. Based on the height distribution statistics, DHD designs Mask Guided Height Sampling (MGHS) to adaptively decoupled the height map into multiple binary masks. MGHS projects the 2D image features into multiple subspaces, where each grid contains features within reasonable height ranges. Finally, a Synergistic Feature Aggregation (SFA) module is deployed to enhance the feature representation through channel and spatial affinities, enabling further occupancy refinement. On the popular Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance even with minimal input frames. Code is available at https://github.com/yanzq95/DHD."
Localized Schrödinger Bridge Sampler,"We consider the generative problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\""odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. A key bottleneck of this approach is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\""odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\""odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. As for the original approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a Gaussian problem with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem."
Locality-aware Cross-modal Correspondence Learning for Dense Audio-Visual Events Localization,"Dense-localization Audio-Visual Events (DAVE) aims to identify time boundaries and corresponding categories for events that can be heard and seen concurrently in an untrimmed video. Existing methods typically encode audio and visual representation separately without any explicit cross-modal alignment constraint. Then they adopt dense cross-modal attention to integrate multimodal information for DAVE. Thus these methods inevitably aggregate irrelevant noise and events, especially in complex and long videos, leading to imprecise detection. In this paper, we present LOCO, a Locality-aware cross-modal Correspondence learning framework for DAVE. The core idea is to explore local temporal continuity nature of audio-visual events, which serves as informative yet free supervision signals to guide the filtering of irrelevant information and inspire the extraction of complementary multimodal information during both unimodal and cross-modal learning stages. i) Specifically, LOCO applies Locality-aware Correspondence Correction (LCC) to uni-modal features via leveraging cross-modal local-correlated properties without any extra annotations. This enforces uni-modal encoders to highlight similar semantics shared by audio and visual features. ii) To better aggregate such audio and visual features, we further customize Cross-modal Dynamic Perception layer (CDP) in cross-modal feature pyramid to understand local temporal patterns of audio-visual events by imposing local consistency within multimodal features in a data-driven manner. By incorporating LCC and CDP, LOCO provides solid performance gains and outperforms existing methods for DAVE. The source code will be released."
ProbTalk3D: Non-Deterministic Emotion Controllable Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation Synthesis Using VQ-VAE,"Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry. While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models. We recommend watching the supplementary video for quality judgement. The entire codebase is publicly available (https://github.com/uuembodiedsocialai/ProbTalk3D/)."
Autonomous Vehicle Controllers From End-to-End Differentiable Simulation,"Current methods to learn controllers for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on behavioural cloning. Being trained only on exact historic data, the resulting agents often generalize poorly to novel scenarios. Simulators provide the opportunity to go beyond offline datasets, but they are still treated as complicated black boxes, only used to update the global simulation state. As a result, these RL algorithms are slow, sample-inefficient, and prior-agnostic. In this work, we leverage a differentiable simulator and design an analytic policy gradients (APG) approach to training AV controllers on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our proposed framework brings the differentiable simulator into an end-to-end training loop, where gradients of the environment dynamics serve as a useful prior to help the agent learn a more grounded policy. We combine this setup with a recurrent architecture that can efficiently propagate temporal information across long simulated trajectories. This APG method allows us to learn robust, accurate, and fast policies, while only requiring widely-available expert trajectories, instead of scarce expert actions. We compare to behavioural cloning and find significant improvements in performance and robustness to noise in the dynamics, as well as overall more intuitive human-like handling."
WirelessAgent: Large Language Model Agents for Intelligent Wireless Networks,"Wireless networks are increasingly facing challenges due to their expanding scale and complexity. These challenges underscore the need for advanced AI-driven strategies, particularly in the upcoming 6G networks. In this article, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to develop AI agents capable of managing complex tasks in wireless networks. It can effectively improve network performance through advanced reasoning, multimodal data processing, and autonomous decision making. Thereafter, we demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of WirelessAgent for network slicing management. The experimental results show that WirelessAgent is capable of accurately understanding user intent, effectively allocating slice resources, and consistently maintaining optimal performance."
Estimating Atmospheric Variables from Digital Typhoon Satellite Images via Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models,"This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons, predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

Do Vision Foundation Models Enhance Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation?,"Neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in many supervised learning tasks when the training data distribution matches the test data distribution. However, their performance drops significantly under domain (covariate) shift, a prevalent issue in medical image segmentation due to varying acquisition settings across different scanner models and protocols. Recently, foundational models (FMs) trained on large datasets have gained attention for their ability to be adapted for downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance with excellent generalization capabilities on natural images. However, their effectiveness in medical image segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the domain generalization performance of various FMs, including DinoV2, SAM, MedSAM, and MAE, when fine-tuned using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Ladder and Rein (+LoRA) and decoder heads. We introduce a novel decode head architecture, HQHSAM, which simply integrates elements from two state-of-the-art decoder heads, HSAM and HQSAM, to enhance segmentation performance. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets, encompassing various anatomies and modalities, reveal that FMs, particularly with the HQHSAM decode head, improve domain generalization for medical image segmentation. Moreover, we found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques varies across different FMs. These findings underscore the potential of FMs to enhance the domain generalization performance of neural networks in medical image segmentation across diverse clinical settings, providing a solid foundation for future research. Code and models are available for research purposes at \url{https://github.com/kerem-cekmeceli/Foundation-Models-for-Medical-Imagery}."
Enhanced Online Grooming Detection Employing Context Determination and Message-Level Analysis,"Online Grooming (OG) is a prevalent threat facing predominately children online, with groomers using deceptive methods to prey on the vulnerability of children on social media/messaging platforms. These attacks can have severe psychological and physical impacts, including a tendency towards revictimization. Current technical measures are inadequate, especially with the advent of end-to-end encryption which hampers message monitoring. Existing solutions focus on the signature analysis of child abuse media, which does not effectively address real-time OG detection. This paper proposes that OG attacks are complex, requiring the identification of specific communication patterns between adults and children. It introduces a novel approach leveraging advanced models such as BERT and RoBERTa for Message-Level Analysis and a Context Determination approach for classifying actor interactions, including the introduction of Actor Significance Thresholds and Message Significance Thresholds. The proposed method aims to enhance accuracy and robustness in detecting OG by considering the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of these attacks. Cross-dataset experiments evaluate the robustness and versatility of our approach. This paper's contributions include improved detection methodologies and the potential for application in various scenarios, addressing gaps in current literature and practices."
Rapid Parameter Estimation for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Using Machine Learning,"Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods. Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy."
Community detection in multi-layer networks by regularized debiased spectral clustering,"Community detection is a crucial problem in the analysis of multi-layer networks. In this work, we introduce a new method, called regularized debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices (RDSoS), to detect latent communities in multi-layer networks. RDSoS is developed based on a novel regularized Laplacian matrix that regularizes the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices. In contrast, the classical regularized Laplacian matrix typically regularizes the adjacency matrix of a single-layer network. Therefore, at a high level, our regularized Laplacian matrix extends the classical regularized Laplacian matrix to multi-layer networks. We establish the consistency property of RDSoS under the multi-layer stochastic block model (MLSBM) and further extend RDSoS and its theoretical results to the degree-corrected version of the MLSBM model. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated and demonstrated through synthetic and real datasets."
What is the Relationship between Tensor Factorizations and Circuits (and How Can We Exploit it)?,"This paper establishes a rigorous connection between circuit representations and tensor factorizations, two seemingly distinct yet fundamentally related areas. By connecting these fields, we highlight a series of opportunities that can benefit both communities. Our work generalizes popular tensor factorizations within the circuit language, and unifies various circuit learning algorithms under a single, generalized hierarchical factorization framework. Specifically, we introduce a modular ""Lego block"" approach to build tensorized circuit architectures. This, in turn, allows us to systematically construct and explore various circuit and tensor factorization models while maintaining tractability. This connection not only clarifies similarities and differences in existing models, but also enables the development of a comprehensive pipeline for building and optimizing new circuit/tensor factorization architectures. We show the effectiveness of our framework through extensive empirical evaluations, and highlight new research opportunities for tensor factorizations in probabilistic modeling."
Repr Types: One Abstraction to Rule Them All,"The choice of how to represent an abstract type can have a major impact on the performance of a program, yet mainstream compilers cannot perform optimizations at such a high level. When dealing with optimizations of data type representations, an important feature is having extensible representation-flexible data types; the ability for a programmer to add new abstract types and operations, as well as concrete implementations of these, without modifying the compiler or a previously defined library. Many research projects support high-level optimizations through static analysis, instrumentation, or benchmarking, but they are all restricted in at least one aspect of extensibility.   This paper presents a new approach to representation-flexible data types without such restrictions and which still finds efficient optimizations. Our approach centers around a single built-in type $\texttt{repr}$ and function overloading with cost annotations for operation implementations. We evaluate our approach (i) by defining a universal collection type as a library, a single type for all conventional collections, and (ii) by designing and implementing a representation-flexible graph library. Programs using $\texttt{repr}$ types are typically faster than programs with idiomatic representation choices -- sometimes dramatically so -- as long as the compiler finds good implementations for all operations. Our compiler performs the analysis efficiently by finding optimized solutions quickly and by reusing previous results to avoid recomputations."
Quickest Change Detection Using Mismatched CUSUM,"The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place and identify properties of the post-change behavior. The goal is to devise a stopping time adapted to the observations that minimizes an $L_1$ loss.   Approximately optimal solutions are well known under a variety of assumptions. In the work surveyed here we consider the CUSUM statistic, which is defined as a one-dimensional reflected random walk driven by a functional of the observations. It is known that the optimal functional is a log likelihood ratio subject to special statical assumptions.   The paper concerns model free approaches to detection design, considering the following questions:   1. What is the performance for a given functional of the observations?   2. How do the conclusions change when there is dependency between pre- and post-change behavior?   3. How can techniques from statistics and machine learning be adapted to approximate the best functional in a given class?"
Collaborative Automatic Modulation Classification via Deep Edge Inference for Hierarchical Cognitive Radio Networks,"In hierarchical cognitive radio networks, edge or cloud servers utilize the data collected by edge devices for modulation classification, which, however, is faced with problems of the transmission overhead, data privacy, and computation load. In this article, an edge learning (EL) based framework jointly mobilizing the edge device and the edge server for intelligent co-inference is proposed to realize the collaborative automatic modulation classification (C-AMC) between them. A spectrum semantic compression neural network (SSCNet) with the lightweight structure is designed for the edge device to compress the collected raw data into a compact semantic message that is then sent to the edge server via the wireless channel. On the edge server side, a modulation classification neural network (MCNet) combining bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi?LSTM) and multi-head attention layers is elaborated to deter?mine the modulation type from the noisy semantic message. By leveraging the computation resources of both the edge device and the edge server, high transmission overhead and risks of data privacy leakage are avoided. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed C-AMC framework, significantly reducing the model size and computational complexity."
Exploring Accessibility Trends and Challenges in Mobile App Development: A Study of Stack Overflow Questions,"The proliferation of mobile applications (apps) has made it crucial to ensure their accessibility for users with disabilities. However, there is a lack of research on the real-world challenges developers face in implementing mobile accessibility features. This study presents a large-scale empirical analysis of accessibility discussions on Stack Overflow to identify the trends and challenges Android and iOS developers face. We examine the growth patterns, characteristics, and common topics mobile developers discuss. Our results show several challenges, including integrating assistive technologies like screen readers, ensuring accessible UI design, supporting text-to-speech across languages, handling complex gestures, and conducting accessibility testing. We envision our findings driving improvements in developer practices, research directions, tool support, and educational resources."
Taylor-Sensus Network: Embracing Noise to Enlighten Uncertainty for Scientific Data,"Uncertainty estimation is crucial in scientific data for machine learning. Current uncertainty estimation methods mainly focus on the model's inherent uncertainty, while neglecting the explicit modeling of noise in the data. Furthermore, noise estimation methods typically rely on temporal or spatial dependencies, which can pose a significant challenge in structured scientific data where such dependencies among samples are often absent. To address these challenges in scientific research, we propose the Taylor-Sensus Network (TSNet). TSNet innovatively uses a Taylor series expansion to model complex, heteroscedastic noise and proposes a deep Taylor block for aware noise distribution. TSNet includes a noise-aware contrastive learning module and a data density perception module for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Additionally, an uncertainty combination operator is used to integrate these uncertainties, and the network is trained using a novel heteroscedastic mean square error loss. TSNet demonstrates superior performance over mainstream and state-of-the-art methods in experiments, highlighting its potential in scientific research and noise resistance. It will be open-source to facilitate the community of ""AI for Science""."
Control+Shift: Generating Controllable Distribution Shifts,"We propose a new method for generating realistic datasets with distribution shifts using any decoder-based generative model. Our approach systematically creates datasets with varying intensities of distribution shifts, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of model performance degradation. We then use these generated datasets to evaluate the performance of various commonly used networks and observe a consistent decline in performance with increasing shift intensity, even when the effect is almost perceptually unnoticeable to the human eye. We see this degradation even when using data augmentations. We also find that enlarging the training dataset beyond a certain point has no effect on the robustness and that stronger inductive biases increase robustness."
Modeling Human Responses by Ordinal Archetypal Analysis,"This paper introduces a novel framework for Archetypal Analysis (AA) tailored to ordinal data, particularly from questionnaires. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method, Ordinal Archetypal Analysis (OAA), bypasses the two-step process of transforming ordinal data into continuous scales and operates directly on the ordinal data. We extend traditional AA methods to handle the subjective nature of questionnaire-based data, acknowledging individual differences in scale perception. We introduce the Response Bias Ordinal Archetypal Analysis (RBOAA), which learns individualized scales for each subject during optimization. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on synthetic data and the European Social Survey dataset, highlighting their potential to provide deeper insights into human behavior and perception. The study underscores the importance of considering response bias in cross-national research and offers a principled approach to analyzing ordinal data through Archetypal Analysis."
Covariance Intersection-based Invariant Kalman Filtering(DInCIKF) for Distributed Pose Estimation,"This paper presents a novel approach to distributed pose estimation in the multi-agent system based on an invariant Kalman filter with covariance intersection. Our method models uncertainties using Lie algebra and applies object-level observations within Lie groups, which have practical application value. We integrate covariance intersection to handle estimates that are correlated and use the invariant Kalman filter for merging independent data sources. This strategy allows us to effectively tackle the complex correlations of cooperative localization among agents, ensuring our estimates are neither too conservative nor overly confident. Additionally, we examine the consistency and stability of our algorithm, providing evidence of its reliability and effectiveness in managing multi-agent systems."
Reinforcement Learning Discovers Efficient Decentralized Graph Path Search Strategies,"Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications. Inspired by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning."
Task-Augmented Cross-View Imputation Network for Partial Multi-View Incomplete Multi-Label Classification,"In real-world scenarios, multi-view multi-label learning often encounters the challenge of incomplete training data due to limitations in data collection and unreliable annotation processes. The absence of multi-view features impairs the comprehensive understanding of samples, omitting crucial details essential for classification. To address this issue, we present a task-augmented cross-view imputation network (TACVI-Net) for the purpose of handling partial multi-view incomplete multi-label classification. Specifically, we employ a two-stage network to derive highly task-relevant features to recover the missing views. In the first stage, we leverage the information bottleneck theory to obtain a discriminative representation of each view by extracting task-relevant information through a view-specific encoder-classifier architecture. In the second stage, an autoencoder based multi-view reconstruction network is utilized to extract high-level semantic representation of the augmented features and recover the missing data, thereby aiding the final classification task. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our TACVI-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."
A convolutional neural network approach to deblending seismic data,"For economic and efficiency reasons, blended acquisition of seismic data is becoming more and more commonplace. Seismic deblending methods are always computationally demanding and normally consist of multiple processing steps. Besides, the parameter setting is not always trivial. Machine learning-based processing has the potential to significantly reduce processing time and to change the way seismic deblending is carried out. We present a data-driven deep learning-based method for fast and efficient seismic deblending. The blended data are sorted from the common source to the common channel domain to transform the character of the blending noise from coherent events to incoherent distributions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed according to the special character of seismic data, and performs deblending with comparable results to those obtained with conventional industry deblending algorithms. To ensure authenticity, the blending was done numerically and only field seismic data were employed, including more than 20000 training examples. After training and validation of the network, seismic deblending can be performed in near real time. Experiments also show that the initial signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the major factor controlling the quality of the final deblended result. The network is also demonstrated to be robust and adaptive by using the trained model to firstly deblend a new data set from a different geological area with a slightly different delay time setting, and secondly deblend shots with blending noise in the top part of the data."
Mobile App Security Trends and Topics: An Examination of Questions From Stack Overflow,"The widespread use of smartphones and tablets has made society heavily reliant on mobile applications (apps) for accessing various resources and services. These apps often handle sensitive personal, financial, and health data, making app security a critical concern for developers. While there is extensive research on software security topics like malware and vulnerabilities, less is known about the practical security challenges mobile app developers face and the guidance they seek. \rev{In this study, we mine Stack Overflow for questions on mobile app security, which we analyze using quantitative and qualitative techniques.} The findings reveal that Stack Overflow is a major resource for developers seeking help with mobile app security, especially for Android apps, and identifies seven main categories of security questions: Secured Communications, Database, App Distribution Service, Encryption, Permissions, File-Specific, and General Security. Insights from this research can inform the development of tools, techniques, and resources by the research and vendor community to better support developers in securing their mobile apps."
A framework for measuring the training efficiency of a neural architecture,"Measuring Efficiency in neural network system development is an open research problem. This paper presents an experimental framework to measure the training efficiency of a neural architecture. To demonstrate our approach, we analyze the training efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks and Bayesian equivalents on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Our results show that training efficiency decays as training progresses and varies across different stopping criteria for a given neural model and learning task. We also find a non-linear relationship between training stopping criteria, training Efficiency, model size, and training Efficiency.   Furthermore, we illustrate the potential confounding effects of overtraining on measuring the training efficiency of a neural architecture. Regarding relative training efficiency across different architectures, our results indicate that CNNs are more efficient than BCNNs on both datasets. More generally, as a learning task becomes more complex, the relative difference in training efficiency between different architectures becomes more pronounced."
Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential-Driven Robot Class,"Differential-driven robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package."
Tidal MerzA: Combining affective modelling and autonomous code generation through Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents Tidal-MerzA, a novel system designed for collaborative performances between humans and a machine agent in the context of live coding, specifically focusing on the generation of musical patterns. Tidal-MerzA fuses two foundational models: ALCAA (Affective Live Coding Autonomous Agent) and Tidal Fuzz, a computational framework. By integrating affective modelling with computational generation, this system leverages reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically adapt music composition parameters within the TidalCycles framework, ensuring both affective qualities to the patterns and syntactical correctness. The development of Tidal-MerzA introduces two distinct agents: one focusing on the generation of mini-notation strings for musical expression, and another on the alignment of music with targeted affective states through reinforcement learning. This approach enhances the adaptability and creative potential of live coding practices and allows exploration of human-machine creative interactions. Tidal-MerzA advances the field of computational music generation, presenting a novel methodology for incorporating artificial intelligence into artistic practices."
InterACT: Inter-dependency Aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical Attention Transformers for Bimanual Manipulation,"We present InterACT: Inter-dependency aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical Attention Transformers, a novel imitation learning framework for bimanual manipulation that integrates hierarchical attention to capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm joint states and visual inputs. InterACT consists of a Hierarchical Attention Encoder and a Multi-arm Decoder, both designed to enhance information aggregation and coordination. The encoder processes multi-modal inputs through segment-wise and cross-segment attention mechanisms, while the decoder leverages synchronization blocks to refine individual action predictions, providing the counterpart's prediction as context. Our experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world bimanual manipulation tasks demonstrate that InterACT significantly outperforms existing methods. Detailed ablation studies validate the contributions of key components of our work, including the impact of CLS tokens, cross-segment encoders, and synchronization blocks."
UGAD: Universal Generative AI Detector utilizing Frequency Fingerprints,"In the wake of a fabricated explosion image at the Pentagon, an ability to discern real images from fake counterparts has never been more critical. Our study introduces a novel multi-modal approach to detect AI-generated images amidst the proliferation of new generation methods such as Diffusion models. Our method, UGAD, encompasses three key detection steps: First, we transform the RGB images into YCbCr channels and apply an Integral Radial Operation to emphasize salient radial features. Secondly, the Spatial Fourier Extraction operation is used for a spatial shift, utilizing a pre-trained deep learning network for optimal feature extraction. Finally, the deep neural network classification stage processes the data through dense layers using softmax for classification. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy of differentiating between real and AI-generated images, as evidenced by a 12.64% increase in accuracy and 28.43% increase in AUC compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."
Multi-granularity Score-based Generative Framework Enables Efficient Inverse Design of Complex Organics,"Efficiently retrieving an enormous chemical library to design targeted molecules is crucial for accelerating drug discovery, organic chemistry, and optoelectronic materials. Despite the emergence of generative models to produce novel drug-like molecules, in a more realistic scenario, the complexity of functional groups (e.g., pyrene, acenaphthylene, and bridged-ring systems) and extensive molecular scaffolds remain challenging obstacles for the generation of complex organics. Traditionally, the former demands an extra learning process, e.g., molecular pre-training, and the latter requires expensive computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose OrgMol-Design, a multi-granularity framework for efficiently designing complex organics. Our OrgMol-Design is composed of a score-based generative model via fragment prior for diverse coarse-grained scaffold generation and a chemical-rule-aware scoring model for fine-grained molecular structure design, circumventing the difficulty of intricate substructure learning without losing connection details among fragments. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four real-world and more challenging benchmarks covering broader scientific domains, outperforming advanced molecule generative models. Additionally, it delivers a substantial speedup and graphics memory reduction compared to diffusion-based graph models. Our results also demonstrate the importance of leveraging fragment prior for a generalized molecule inverse design model."
Tera-SpaceCom: GNN-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Task Offloading in TeraHertz Band Space Networks,"Terahertz (THz) space communications (Tera-SpaceCom) is envisioned as a promising technology to enable various space science and communication applications. Mainly, the realm of Tera-SpaceCom consists of THz sensing for space exploration, data centers in space providing cloud services for space exploration tasks, and a low earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation relaying these tasks to ground stations (GSs) or data centers via THz links. Moreover, to reduce the computational burden on data centers as well as resource consumption and latency in the relaying process, the LEO mega-constellation provides satellite edge computing (SEC) services to directly compute space exploration tasks without relaying these tasks to data centers. The LEO satellites that receive space exploration tasks offload (i.e., distribute) partial tasks to their neighboring LEO satellites, to further reduce their computational burden. However, efficient joint communication resource allocation and computing task offloading for the Tera-SpaceCom SEC network is an NP-hard mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), due to the discrete nature of space exploration tasks and sub-arrays as well as the continuous nature of transmit power. To tackle this challenge, a graph neural network (GNN)-deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based joint resource allocation and task offloading (GRANT) algorithm is proposed with the target of long-term resource efficiency (RE). Particularly, GNNs learn relationships among different satellites from their connectivity information. Furthermore, multi-agent and multi-task mechanisms cooperatively train task offloading and resource allocation. Compared with benchmark solutions, GRANT not only achieves the highest RE with relatively low latency, but realizes the fewest trainable parameters and the shortest running time."
From COCO to COCO-FP: A Deep Dive into Background False Positives for COCO Detectors,"Reducing false positives is essential for enhancing object detector performance, as reflected in the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric. Although object detectors have achieved notable improvements and high mAP scores on the COCO dataset, analysis reveals limited progress in addressing false positives caused by non-target visual clutter-background objects not included in the annotated categories. This issue is particularly critical in real-world applications, such as fire and smoke detection, where minimizing false alarms is crucial. In this study, we introduce COCO-FP, a new evaluation dataset derived from the ImageNet-1K dataset, designed to address this issue. By extending the original COCO validation dataset, COCO-FP specifically assesses object detectors' performance in mitigating background false positives. Our evaluation of both standard and advanced object detectors shows a significant number of false positives in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. For example, the AP50 metric for YOLOv9-E decreases from 72.8 to 65.7 when shifting from COCO to COCO-FP. The dataset is available at https://github.com/COCO-FP/COCO-FP."
Building a Cybersecurity Risk Metamodel for Improved Method and Tool Integration,"Nowadays, companies are highly exposed to cyber security threats. In many industrial domains, protective measures are being deployed and actively supported by standards. However the global process remains largely dependent on document driven approach or partial modelling which impacts both the efficiency and effectiveness of the cybersecurity process from the risk analysis step. In this paper, we report on our experience in applying a model-driven approach on the initial risk analysis step in connection with a later security testing. Our work rely on a common metamodel which is used to map, synchronise and ensure information traceability across different tools. We validate our approach using different scenarios relying domain modelling, system modelling, risk assessment and security testing tools."
FACT: Feature Adaptive Continual-learning Tracker for Multiple Object Tracking,"Multiple object tracking (MOT) involves identifying multiple targets and assigning them corresponding IDs within a video sequence, where occlusions are often encountered. Recent methods address occlusions using appearance cues through online learning techniques to improve adaptivity or offline learning techniques to utilize temporal information from videos. However, most existing online learning-based MOT methods are unable to learn from all past tracking information to improve adaptivity on long-term occlusions while maintaining real-time tracking speed. On the other hand, temporal information-based offline learning methods maintain a long-term memory to store past tracking information, but this approach restricts them to use only local past information during tracking. To address these challenges, we propose a new MOT framework called the Feature Adaptive Continual-learning Tracker (FACT), which enables real-time tracking and feature learning for targets by utilizing all past tracking information. We demonstrate that the framework can be integrated with various state-of-the-art feature-based trackers, thereby improving their tracking ability. Specifically, we develop the feature adaptive continual-learning (FAC) module, a neural network that can be trained online to learn features adaptively using all past tracking information during tracking. Moreover, we also introduce a two-stage association module specifically designed for the proposed continual learning-based tracking. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art online tracking performance on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."
Dynamic Simultaneous Multithreaded Architecture,"This paper presents the Dynamic Simultaneous Multi-threaded Architecture (DSMT). DSMT efficiently exe-cutes multiple threads from a single program on a SMT processor core. To accomplish this, threads are generated dynamically from a predictable flow of control and then executed speculatively. Data obtained during the single context non-speculative execution phase of DSMT is used as a hint to speculate the posterior behavior of multiple threads. DSMT employs simple mechanisms based on state bits that keep track of inter-thread dependencies in registers and memory, synchronize thread execution, and control recovery from misspeculation. Moreover, DSMT utilizes a novel greedy policy for choosing those sections of code which provide the highest performance based on their past execution history. The DSMT architecture was simulated with a new cycle-accurate, execution-driven simulator. Our simulation results show that DSMT has very good potential to improve SMT performance, even when only a single program is available. However, we found that dynamic thread behavior together with fre-quent misspeculation may also produce diminishing re-turns in performance. Therefore, the challenge is to max-imize the amount of thread-level parallelism that DSMT is capable of exploiting and at the same time reduce the fre-quency of misspeculations."
Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints,"This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks."
Bridging Discrete and Continuous: A Multimodal Strategy for Complex Emotion Detection,"In the domain of human-computer interaction, accurately recognizing and interpreting human emotions is crucial yet challenging due to the complexity and subtlety of emotional expressions. This study explores the potential for detecting a rich and flexible range of emotions through a multimodal approach which integrates facial expressions, voice tones, and transcript from video clips. We propose a novel framework that maps variety of emotions in a three-dimensional Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space, which could reflect the fluctuations and positivity/negativity of emotions to enable a more variety and comprehensive representation of emotional states. We employed K-means clustering to transit emotions from traditional discrete categorization to a continuous labeling system and built a classifier for emotion recognition upon this system. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using the MER2024 dataset, which contains culturally consistent video clips from Chinese movies and TV series, annotated with both discrete and open-vocabulary emotion labels. Our experiment successfully achieved the transformation between discrete and continuous models, and the proposed model generated a more diverse and comprehensive set of emotion vocabulary while maintaining strong accuracy."
Microscopic-Mamba: Revealing the Secrets of Microscopic Images with Just 4M Parameters,"In the field of medical microscopic image classification (MIC), CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been extensively studied. However, CNNs struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, limiting their ability to fully utilize semantic information in images. Conversely, Transformers are hampered by the complexity of quadratic computations. To address these challenges, we propose a model based on the Mamba architecture: Microscopic-Mamba. Specifically, we designed the Partially Selected Feed-Forward Network (PSFFN) to replace the last linear layer of the Visual State Space Module (VSSM), enhancing Mamba's local feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we introduced the Modulation Interaction Feature Aggregation (MIFA) module to effectively modulate and dynamically aggregate global and local features. We also incorporated a parallel VSSM mechanism to improve inter-channel information interaction while reducing the number of parameters. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/zs1314/Microscopic-Mamba"
Rapid mixing of the flip chain over non-crossing spanning trees,We show that the flip chain for non-crossing spanning trees of $n+1$ points in convex position mixes in time $O(n^8\log n)$.
A corpus-based investigation of pitch contours of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin,"In Mandarin, the tonal contours of monosyllabic words produced in isolation or in careful speech are characterized by four lexical tones: a high-level tone (T1), a rising tone (T2), a dipping tone (T3) and a falling tone (T4). However, in spontaneous speech, the actual tonal realization of monosyllabic words can deviate significantly from these canonical tones due to intra-syllabic co-articulation and inter-syllabic co-articulation with adjacent tones. In addition, Chuang et al. (2024) recently reported that the tonal contours of disyllabic Mandarin words with T2-T4 tone pattern are co-determined by their meanings. Following up on their research, we present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of contextual predictors on the one hand, and the way in words' meanings co-determine pitch contours on the other hand. We analyze the F0 contours of 3824 tokens of 63 different word types in a spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin corpus, using the generalized additive (mixed) model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours. We show that the tonal context substantially modify a word's canonical tone. Once the effect of tonal context is controlled for, T2 and T3 emerge as low flat tones, contrasting with T1 as a high tone, and with T4 as a high-to-mid falling tone. The neutral tone (T0), which in standard descriptions, is realized based on the preceding tone, emerges as a low tone in its own right, modified by the other predictors in the same way as the standard tones T1, T2, T3, and T4. We also show that word, and even more so, word sense, co-determine words' F0 contours. Analyses of variable importance using random forests further supported the substantial effect of tonal context and an effect of word sense."
BLens: Contrastive Captioning of Binary Functions using Ensemble Embedding,"Function names can greatly aid human reverse engineers, which has spurred development of machine learning-based approaches to predicting function names in stripped binaries. Much current work in this area now uses transformers, applying a metaphor of machine translation from code to function names. Still, function naming models face challenges in generalizing to projects completely unrelated to the training set. In this paper, we take a completely new approach by transferring advances in automated image captioning to the domain of binary reverse engineering, such that different parts of a binary function can be associated with parts of its name. We propose BLens, which combines multiple binary function embeddings into a new ensemble representation, aligns it with the name representation latent space via a contrastive learning approach, and generates function names with a transformer architecture tailored for function names. In our experiments, we demonstrate that BLens significantly outperforms the state of the art. In the usual setting of splitting per binary, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.77 compared to 0.67. Moreover, in the cross-project setting, which emphasizes generalizability, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.46 compared to 0.29."
UNIT: Unsupervised Online Instance Segmentation through Time,"Online object segmentation and tracking in Lidar point clouds enables autonomous agents to understand their surroundings and make safe decisions. Unfortunately, manual annotations for these tasks are prohibitively costly. We tackle this problem with the task of class-agnostic unsupervised online instance segmentation and tracking. To that end, we leverage an instance segmentation backbone and propose a new training recipe that enables the online tracking of objects. Our network is trained on pseudo-labels, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We conduct an evaluation using metrics adapted for temporal instance segmentation. Computing these metrics requires temporally-consistent instance labels. When unavailable, we construct these labels using the available 3D bounding boxes and semantic labels in the dataset. We compare our method against strong baselines and demonstrate its superiority across two different outdoor Lidar datasets."
Graph Neural Networks for Parkinsons Disease Detection,"Despite the promising performance of state of the art approaches for Parkinsons Disease (PD) detection, these approaches often analyze individual speech segments in isolation, which can lead to suboptimal results. Dysarthric cues that characterize speech impairments from PD patients are expected to be related across segments from different speakers. Isolated segment analysis fails to exploit these inter segment relationships. Additionally, not all speech segments from PD patients exhibit clear dysarthric symptoms, introducing label noise that can negatively affect the performance and generalizability of current approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel PD detection framework utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing speech segments as nodes and capturing the similarity between segments through edges, our GCN model facilitates the aggregation of dysarthric cues across the graph, effectively exploiting segment relationships and mitigating the impact of label noise. Experimental results demonstrate theadvantages of the proposed GCN model for PD detection and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms"
$\mathbb{N}$-polyregular functions arise from well-quasi-orderings,"A fundamental construction in formal language theory is the Myhill-Nerode congruence on words, whose finitedness characterizes regular language. This construction was generalized to functions from $\Sigma^*$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ by Colcombet, Dou\'eneau-Tabot, and Lopez to characterize the class of so-called $\mathbb{Z}$-polyregular functions. In this paper, we relax the notion of equivalence relation to quasi-ordering in order to study the class of $\mathbb{N}$-polyregular functions, that plays the role of $\mathbb{Z}$-polyregular functions among functions from $\Sigma^*$ to $\mathbb{N}$. The analogue of having a finite index is then being a well-quasi-ordering. This provides a canonical object to describe $\mathbb{N}$-polyregular functions, together with a powerful new characterization of this class."
Non-negative Weighted DAG Structure Learning,"We address the problem of learning the topology of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from nodal observations, which adhere to a linear structural equation model. Recent advances framed the combinatorial DAG structure learning task as a continuous optimization problem, yet existing methods must contend with the complexities of non-convex optimization. To overcome this limitation, we assume that the latent DAG contains only non-negative edge weights. Leveraging this additional structure, we argue that cycles can be effectively characterized (and prevented) using a convex acyclicity function based on the log-determinant of the adjacency matrix. This convexity allows us to relax the task of learning the non-negative weighted DAG as an abstract convex optimization problem. We propose a DAG recovery algorithm based on the method of multipliers, that is guaranteed to return a global minimizer. Furthermore, we prove that in the infinite sample size regime, the convexity of our approach ensures the recovery of the true DAG structure. We empirically validate the performance of our algorithm in several reproducible synthetic-data test cases, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives."
Randomized Spline Trees for Functional Data Classification: Theory and Application to Environmental Time Series,"Functional data analysis (FDA) and ensemble learning can be powerful tools for analyzing complex environmental time series. Recent literature has highlighted the key role of diversity in enhancing accuracy and reducing variance in ensemble methods.This paper introduces Randomized Spline Trees (RST), a novel algorithm that bridges these two approaches by incorporating randomized functional representations into the Random Forest framework. RST generates diverse functional representations of input data using randomized B-spline parameters, creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on these varied representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of how this functional diversity contributes to reducing generalization error and present empirical evaluations on six environmental time series classification tasks from the UCR Time Series Archive. Results show that RST variants outperform standard Random Forests and Gradient Boosting on most datasets, improving classification accuracy by up to 14\%. The success of RST demonstrates the potential of adaptive functional representations in capturing complex temporal patterns in environmental data. This work contributes to the growing field of machine learning techniques focused on functional data and opens new avenues for research in environmental time series analysis."
Mapping Technical Safety Research at AI Companies: A literature review and incentives analysis,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more advanced, concerns about large-scale risks from misuse or accidents have grown. This report analyzes the technical research into safe AI development being conducted by three leading AI companies: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI.   We define safe AI development as developing AI systems that are unlikely to pose large-scale misuse or accident risks. This encompasses a range of technical approaches aimed at ensuring AI systems behave as intended and do not cause unintended harm, even as they are made more capable and autonomous.   We analyzed all papers published by the three companies from January 2022 to July 2024 that were relevant to safe AI development, and categorized the 61 included papers into eight safety approaches. Additionally, we noted three categories representing nascent approaches explored by academia and civil society, but not currently represented in any papers by the three companies. Our analysis reveals where corporate attention is concentrated and where potential gaps lie.   Some AI research may stay unpublished for good reasons, such as to not inform adversaries about security techniques they would need to overcome to misuse AI systems. Therefore, we also considered the incentives that AI companies have to research each approach. In particular, we considered reputational effects, regulatory burdens, and whether the approaches could make AI systems more useful.   We identified three categories where there are currently no or few papers and where we do not expect AI companies to become more incentivized to pursue this research in the future. These are multi-agent safety, model organisms of misalignment, and safety by design. Our findings provide an indication that these approaches may be slow to progress without funding or efforts from government, civil society, philanthropists, or academia."
"Objection Overruled! Lay People can Distinguish Large Language Models from Lawyers, but still Favour Advice from an LLM","Large Language Models (LLMs) are seemingly infiltrating every domain, and the legal context is no exception. In this paper, we present the results of three experiments (total N=288) that investigated lay people's willingness to act upon, and their ability to discriminate between, LLM- and lawyer-generated legal advice. In Experiment 1, participants judged their willingness to act on legal advice when the source of the advice was either known or unknown. When the advice source was unknown, participants indicated that they were significantly more willing to act on the LLM-generated advice. This result was replicated in Experiment 2. Intriguingly, despite participants indicating higher willingness to act on LLM-generated advice in Experiments 1 and 2, participants discriminated between the LLM- and lawyer-generated texts significantly above chance-level in Experiment 3. Lastly, we discuss potential explanations and risks of our findings, limitations and future work, and the importance of language complexity and real-world comparability."
Learning Rules from KGs Guided by Language Models,"Advances in information extraction have enabled the automatic construction of large knowledge graphs (e.g., Yago, Wikidata or Google KG), which are widely used in many applications like semantic search or data analytics. However, due to their semi-automatic construction, KGs are often incomplete. Rule learning methods, concerned with the extraction of frequent patterns from KGs and casting them into rules, can be applied to predict potentially missing facts. A crucial step in this process is rule ranking. Ranking of rules is especially challenging over highly incomplete or biased KGs (e.g., KGs predominantly storing facts about famous people), as in this case biased rules might fit the data best and be ranked at the top based on standard statistical metrics like rule confidence. To address this issue, prior works proposed to rank rules not only relying on the original KG but also facts predicted by a KG embedding model. At the same time, with the recent rise of Language Models (LMs), several works have claimed that LMs can be used as alternative means for KG completion. In this work, our goal is to verify to which extent the exploitation of LMs is helpful for improving the quality of rule learning systems."
An Optimal Algorithm for Sorting Pattern-Avoiding Sequences,"We present a deterministic comparison-based algorithm that sorts sequences avoiding a fixed permutation $\pi$ in linear time, even if $\pi$ is a priori unkown. Moreover, the dependence of the multiplicative constant on the pattern $\pi$ matches the information-theoretic lower bound. A crucial ingredient is an algorithm for performing efficient multi-way merge based on the Marcus-Tardos theorem. As a direct corollary, we obtain a linear-time algorithm for sorting permutations of bounded twin-width."
Collaboration Encouraging Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme with Seal Property,"A new concept of quantum secret sharing is introduced, in which collaboration among participants are encourage. And the dealer can ask the participants to send back their share and revoke the secret before a predefined date or event, i.e. so-called seal property. We also give two concrete constructions of CE-QSS-Seal (Collaboration-Encouraging Quantum Secret Sharing with Seal property) scheme. The first one is unconditional secure and achieve the optimal bound of a seal scheme. The second one improve the optimal bound of seal by introducing post-quantum secure computational assumption."
Context-Aware Optimal Transport Learning for Retinal Fundus Image Enhancement,"Retinal fundus photography offers a non-invasive way to diagnose and monitor a variety of retinal diseases, but is prone to inherent quality glitches arising from systemic imperfections or operator/patient-related factors. However, high-quality retinal images are crucial for carrying out accurate diagnoses and automated analyses. The fundus image enhancement is typically formulated as a distribution alignment problem, by finding a one-to-one mapping between a low-quality image and its high-quality counterpart. This paper proposes a context-informed optimal transport (OT) learning framework for tackling unpaired fundus image enhancement. In contrast to standard generative image enhancement methods, which struggle with handling contextual information (e.g., over-tampered local structures and unwanted artifacts), the proposed context-aware OT learning paradigm better preserves local structures and minimizes unwanted artifacts. Leveraging deep contextual features, we derive the proposed context-aware OT using the earth mover's distance and show that the proposed context-OT has a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, as well as two downstream tasks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Retinal-Research/Contextual-OT}."
Audio Decoding by Inverse Problem Solving,"We consider audio decoding as an inverse problem and solve it through diffusion posterior sampling. Explicit conditioning functions are developed for input signal measurements provided by an example of a transform domain perceptual audio codec. Viability is demonstrated by evaluating arbitrary pairings of a set of bitrates and task-agnostic prior models. For instance, we observe significant improvements on piano while maintaining speech performance when a speech model is replaced by a joint model trained on both speech and piano. With a more general music model, improved decoding compared to legacy methods is obtained for a broad range of content types and bitrates. The noisy mean model, underlying the proposed derivation of conditioning, enables a significant reduction of gradient evaluations for diffusion posterior sampling, compared to methods based on Tweedie's mean. Combining Tweedie's mean with our conditioning functions improves the objective performance. An audio demo is available at https://dpscodec-demo.github.io/."

Improve Machine Learning carbon footprint using Nvidia GPU and Mixed Precision training for classification algorithms,"This study was part of my dissertation for my master degree and compares the power consumption using the default floating point (32bit) and Nvidia mixed precision (16bit and 32bit) while training a classification ML model. A custom PC with specific hardware was built to perform the experiments, and different ML hyper-parameters, such as batch size, neurons, and epochs, were chosen to build Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Additionally, various software was used during the experiments to collect the power consumption data in Watts from the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM) and manually from a wattmeter connected to the wall. A benchmarking test with default hyper parameter values for the DNN was used as a reference, while the experiments used a combination of different settings. The results were recorded in Excel, and descriptive statistics were chosen to calculate the mean between the groups and compare them using graphs and tables. The outcome was positive when using mixed precision combined with specific hyper-parameters. Compared to the benchmarking, the optimisation for the classification reduced the power consumption between 7 and 11 Watts. Similarly, the carbon footprint is reduced because the calculation uses the same power consumption data. Still, a consideration is required when configuring hyper-parameters because it can negatively affect hardware performance. However, this research required inferential statistics, specifically ANOVA and T-test, to compare the relationship between the means. Furthermore, tests indicated no statistical significance of the relationship between the benchmarking and experiments. However, a more extensive implementation with a cluster of GPUs can increase the sample size significantly, as it is an essential factor and can change the outcome of the statistical analysis."
A Toolchain for Assisting Migration of Software Executables Towards Post-Quantum Cryptography,"Quantum computing poses a significant global threat to today's security mechanisms. As a result, security experts and public sectors have issued guidelines to help organizations migrate their software to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Despite these efforts, there is a lack of (semi-)automatic tools to support this transition especially when software is used and deployed as binary executables. To address this gap, in this work, we first propose a set of requirements necessary for a tool to detect quantum-vulnerable software executables. Following these requirements, we introduce QED: a toolchain for Quantum-vulnerable Executable Detection. QED uses a three-phase approach to identify quantum-vulnerable dependencies in a given set of executables, from file-level to API-level, and finally, precise identification of a static trace that triggers a quantum-vulnerable API. We evaluate QED on both a synthetic dataset with four cryptography libraries and a real-world dataset with over 200 software executables. The results demonstrate that: (1) QED discerns quantum-vulnerable from quantum-safe executables with 100% accuracy in the synthetic dataset; (2) QED is practical and scalable, completing analyses on average in less than 4 seconds per real-world executable; and (3) QED reduces the manual workload required by analysts to identify quantum-vulnerable executables in the real-world dataset by more than 90%. We hope that QED can become a crucial tool to facilitate the transition to PQC, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses with limited resources."
Enhancing Cross-Market Recommendation System with Graph Isomorphism Networks: A Novel Approach to Personalized User Experience,"In today's world of globalized commerce, cross-market recommendation systems (CMRs) are crucial for providing personalized user experiences across diverse market segments. However, traditional recommendation algorithms have difficulties dealing with market specificity and data sparsity, especially in new or emerging markets. In this paper, we propose the CrossGR model, which utilizes Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) to improve CMR systems. It outperforms existing benchmarks in NDCG@10 and HR@10 metrics, demonstrating its adaptability and accuracy in handling diverse market segments. The CrossGR model is adaptable and accurate, making it well-suited for handling the complexities of cross-market recommendation tasks. Its robustness is demonstrated by consistent performance across different evaluation timeframes, indicating its potential to cater to evolving market trends and user preferences. Our findings suggest that GINs represent a promising direction for CMRs, paving the way for more sophisticated, personalized, and context-aware recommendation systems in the dynamic landscape of global e-commerce."
Basis sequence reconfiguration in the union of matroids,"Given a graph $G$ and two spanning trees $T$ and $T'$ in $G$, Spanning Tree Reconfiguration asks whether there is a step-by-step transformation from $T$ to $T'$ such that all intermediates are also spanning trees of $G$, by exchanging an edge in $T$ with an edge outside $T$ at a single step. This problem is naturally related to matroid theory, which shows that there always exists such a transformation for any pair of $T$ and $T'$. Motivated by this example, we study the problem of transforming a sequence of spanning trees into another sequence of spanning trees. We formulate this problem in the language of matroid theory: Given two sequences of bases of matroids, the goal is to decide whether there is a transformation between these sequences. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, even if the matroids are given as basis oracles. To complement this algorithmic result, we show that the problem of finding a shortest transformation is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $c \log n$ for some constant $c > 0$, where $n$ is the total size of the ground sets of the input matroids."
C3-VQA: Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for Variational Quantum Algorithms,"Cryogenic quantum computers play a leading role in demonstrating quantum advantage. Given the severe constraints on the cooling capacity in cryogenic environments, thermal design is crucial for the scalability of these computers. The sources of heat dissipation include passive inflow via inter-temperature wires and the power consumption of components located in the cryostat, such as wire amplifiers and quantum-classical interfaces. Thus, a critical challenge is to reduce the number of wires by reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth while maintaining minimal additional power consumption in the cryostat. One solution to address this challenge is near-data processing using ultra-low-power computational logic within the cryostat. Based on the workload analysis and domain-specific system design focused on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), we propose the Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for VQAs (C3-VQA) to enhance the design scalability of cryogenic quantum computers under the thermal constraint. The C3-VQA utilizes single-flux-quantum logic, which is an ultra-low-power superconducting digital circuit that operates at the 4 K environment. The C3-VQA precomputes a part of the expectation value calculations for VQAs and buffers intermediate values using simple bit operation units and counters in the cryostat, thereby reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth with small additional power consumption. Consequently, the C3-VQA reduces the number of wires, leading to a reduction in the total heat dissipation in the cryostat. Our evaluation shows that the C3-VQA reduces the total heat dissipation at the 4 K stage by 30% and 81% under sequential-shot and parallel-shot execution scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a case study in quantum chemistry shows that the C3-VQA reduces total heat dissipation by 87% with a 10,000-qubit system."
Learning Skateboarding for Humanoid Robots through Massively Parallel Reinforcement Learning,"Learning-based methods have proven useful at generating complex motions for robots, including humanoids.

Initial results in simulation are presented with hardware experiments in progress."
Real-time Multi-view Omnidirectional Depth Estimation System for Robots and Autonomous Driving on Real Scenes,"Omnidirectional Depth Estimation has broad application prospects in fields such as robotic navigation and autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a robotic prototype system and corresponding algorithm designed to validate omnidirectional depth estimation for navigation and obstacle avoidance in real-world scenarios for both robots and vehicles. The proposed HexaMODE system captures 360$^\circ$ depth maps using six surrounding arranged fisheye cameras. We introduce a combined spherical sweeping method and optimize the model architecture for proposed RtHexa-OmniMVS algorithm to achieve real-time omnidirectional depth estimation. To ensure high accuracy, robustness, and generalization in real-world environments, we employ a teacher-student self-training strategy, utilizing large-scale unlabeled real-world data for model training. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in various complex real-world scenarios, both indoors and outdoors, achieving an inference speed of 15 fps on edge computing platforms."
TSELM: Target Speaker Extraction using Discrete Tokens and Language Models,"We propose TSELM, a novel target speaker extraction network that leverages discrete tokens and language models. TSELM utilizes multiple discretized layers from WavLM as input tokens and incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to integrate target speaker information. Language models are employed to capture the sequence dependencies, while a scalable HiFi-GAN is used to reconstruct the audio from the tokens. By applying a cross-entropy loss, TSELM models the probability distribution of output tokens, thus converting the complex regression problem of audio generation into a classification task. Experimental results show that TSELM achieves excellent results in speech quality and comparable results in speech intelligibility."
Computing the LZ-End parsing: Easy to implement and practically efficient,"The LZ-End parsing [Kreft & Navarro, 2011] of an input string yields compression competitive with the popular Lempel-Ziv 77 scheme, but also allows for efficient random access. Kempa and Kosolobov showed that the parsing can be computed in time and space linear in the input length [Kempa & Kosolobov, 2017], however, the corresponding algorithm is hardly practical. We put the spotlight on their suboptimal algorithm that computes the parsing in time $\mathcal{O}(n \lg\lg n)$. It requires a comparatively small toolset and is therefore easy to implement, but at the same time very efficient in practice. We give a detailed and simplified description with a full listing that incorporates undocumented tricks from the original implementation, but also uses lazy evaluation to reduce the workload in practice and requires less working memory by removing a level of indirection. We legitimize our algorithm in a brief benchmark, obtaining the parsing faster than the state of the art."
FPMT: Enhanced Semi-Supervised Model for Traffic Incident Detection,"For traffic incident detection, the acquisition of data and labels is notably resource-intensive, rendering semi-supervised traffic incident detection both a formidable and consequential challenge. Thus, this paper focuses on traffic incident detection with a semi-supervised learning way. It proposes a semi-supervised learning model named FPMT within the framework of MixText. The data augmentation module introduces Generative Adversarial Networks to balance and expand the dataset. During the mix-up process in the hidden space, it employs a probabilistic pseudo-mixing mechanism to enhance regularization and elevate model precision. In terms of training strategy, it initiates with unsupervised training on all data, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a subset of labeled data, and ultimately completing the goal of semi-supervised training. Through empirical validation on four authentic datasets, our FPMT model exhibits outstanding performance across various metrics. Particularly noteworthy is its robust performance even in scenarios with low label rates."
Maximum And- vs. Even-SAT,"A (multi)set of literals, called a clause, is strongly satisfied by an assignment if no literal evaluates to false. Finding an assignment that maximises the number of strongly satisfied clauses is NP-hard. We present a simple algorithm that finds, given a set of clauses that admits an assignment that strongly satisfies a $\rho$-fraction of the clauses, an assignment in which at least a $\rho$-fraction of the clauses is weakly satisfied, in the sense that an even number of literals evaluates to false. In particular, this implies an efficient algorithm for finding an undirected cut of value $\rho$ in a graph given that a directed cut of value $\rho$ in the graph is promised to exist."
Measuring the limit of perception of bond stiffness of interactive molecules in VR via a gamified psychophysics experiment,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide crucial insight into molecular interactions and biomolecular function. With interactive MD simulations in VR (iMD-VR), chemists can now interact with these molecular simulations in real-time. Our sense of touch is essential for exploring the properties of physical objects, but recreating this sensory experience for virtual objects poses challenges. Furthermore, employing haptics in the context of molecular simulation is especially difficult since \textit{we do not know what molecules actually feel like}. In this paper, we build upon previous work that demonstrated how VR-users can distinguish properties of molecules without haptic feedback. We present the results of a gamified two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) psychophysics user study in which we quantify the threshold at which iMD-VR users can differentiate the stiffness of molecular bonds. Our preliminary analysis suggests that participants can sense differences between buckminsterfullerene molecules with different bond stiffness parameters and that this limit may fall within the chemically relevant range. Our results highlight how iMD-VR may facilitate a more embodied way of exploring complex and dynamic molecular systems, enabling chemists to sense the properties of molecules purely by interacting with them in VR."
Structured Pruning for Efficient Visual Place Recognition,"Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is fundamental for the global re-localization of robots and devices, enabling them to recognize previously visited locations based on visual inputs. This capability is crucial for maintaining accurate mapping and localization over large areas. Given that VPR methods need to operate in real-time on embedded systems, it is critical to optimize these systems for minimal resource consumption. While the most efficient VPR approaches employ standard convolutional backbones with fixed descriptor dimensions, these often lead to redundancy in the embedding space as well as in the network architecture. Our work introduces a novel structured pruning method, to not only streamline common VPR architectures but also to strategically remove redundancies within the feature embedding space. This dual focus significantly enhances the efficiency of the system, reducing both map and model memory requirements and decreasing feature extraction and retrieval latencies. Our approach has reduced memory usage and latency by 21% and 16%, respectively, across models, while minimally impacting recall@1 accuracy by less than 1%. This significant improvement enhances real-time applications on edge devices with negligible accuracy loss."
Classifying Images with CoLaNET Spiking Neural Network -- the MNIST Example,"In the present paper, it is shown how the columnar/layered CoLaNET spiking neural network (SNN) architecture can be used in supervised learning image classification tasks. Image pixel brightness is coded by the spike count during image presentation period. Image class label is indicated by activity of special SNN input nodes (one node per class). The CoLaNET classification accuracy is evaluated on the MNIST benchmark. It is demonstrated that CoLaNET is almost as accurate as the most advanced machine learning algorithms (not using convolutional approach)."
Efficient and Reliable Vector Similarity Search Using Asymmetric Encoding with NAND-Flash for Many-Class Few-Shot Learning,"While memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) offer an effective solution for few-shot learning (FSL) by integrating deep neural networks with external memory, the capacity requirements and energy overhead of data movement become enormous due to the large number of support vectors in many-class FSL scenarios. Various in-memory search solutions have emerged to improve the energy efficiency of MANNs. NAND-based multi-bit content addressable memory (MCAM) is a promising option due to its high density and large capacity. Despite its potential, MCAM faces limitations such as a restricted number of word lines, limited quantization levels, and non-ideal effects like varying string currents and bottleneck effects, which lead to significant accuracy drops. To address these issues, we propose several innovative methods. First, the Multi-bit Thermometer Code (MTMC) leverages the extensive capacity of MCAM to enhance vector precision using cumulative encoding rules, thereby mitigating the bottleneck effect. Second, the Asymmetric vector similarity search (AVSS) reduces the precision of the query vector while maintaining that of the support vectors, thereby minimizing the search iterations and improving efficiency in many-class scenarios. Finally, the Hardware-Aware Training (HAT) method optimizes controller training by modeling the hardware characteristics of MCAM, thus enhancing the reliability of the system. Our integrated framework reduces search iterations by up to 32 times, and increases overall accuracy by 1.58% to 6.94%."
ReGentS: Real-World Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation Made Stable,"Machine learning based autonomous driving systems often face challenges with safety-critical scenarios that are rare in real-world data, hindering their large-scale deployment. While increasing real-world training data coverage could address this issue, it is costly and dangerous. This work explores generating safety-critical driving scenarios by modifying complex real-world regular scenarios through trajectory optimization. We propose ReGentS, which stabilizes generated trajectories and introduces heuristics to avoid obvious collisions and optimization problems. Our approach addresses unrealistic diverging trajectories and unavoidable collision scenarios that are not useful for training robust planner. We also extend the scenario generation framework to handle real-world data with up to 32 agents. Additionally, by using a differentiable simulator, our approach simplifies gradient descent-based optimization involving a simulator, paving the way for future advancements. The code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/ReGentS."
Enabling Cost-Effective UI Automation Testing with Retrieval-Based LLMs: A Case Study in WeChat,"UI automation tests play a crucial role in ensuring the quality of mobile applications. Despite the growing popularity of machine learning techniques to generate these tests, they still face several challenges, such as the mismatch of UI elements. The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed these issues by leveraging their semantic understanding capabilities. However, a significant gap remains in applying these models to industrial-level app testing, particularly in terms of cost optimization and knowledge limitation. To address this, we introduce CAT to create cost-effective UI automation tests for industry apps by combining machine learning and LLMs with best practices. Given the task description, CAT employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to source examples of industrial app usage as the few-shot learning context, assisting LLMs in generating the specific sequence of actions. CAT then employs machine learning techniques, with LLMs serving as a complementary optimizer, to map the target element on the UI screen. Our evaluations on the WeChat testing dataset demonstrate the CAT's performance and cost-effectiveness, achieving 90% UI automation with $0.34 cost, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We have also integrated our approach into the real-world WeChat testing platform, demonstrating its usefulness in detecting 141 bugs and enhancing the developers' testing process."
Bridging Paintings and Music -- Exploring Emotion based Music Generation through Paintings,"Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced generative tasks involving music and images, employing both unimodal and multimodal approaches. This research develops a model capable of generating music that resonates with the emotions depicted in visual arts, integrating emotion labeling, image captioning, and language models to transform visual inputs into musical compositions. Addressing the scarcity of aligned art and music data, we curated the Emotion Painting Music Dataset, pairing paintings with corresponding music for effective training and evaluation. Our dual-stage framework converts images to text descriptions of emotional content and then transforms these descriptions into music, facilitating efficient learning with minimal data. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Inception Score (IS), and KL divergence, with audio-emotion text similarity confirmed by the pre-trained CLAP model to demonstrate high alignment between generated music and text. This synthesis tool bridges visual art and music, enhancing accessibility for the visually impaired and opening avenues in educational and therapeutic applications by providing enriched multi-sensory experiences."

It is the first comprehensive survey that covers the historical background and the distinction between MLMM and standard multimodal learning setups, followed by a detailed analysis of current MLMM methods, applications, and datasets, concluding with a discussion about challenges and potential future directions in the field."
Online vs Offline: A Comparative Study of First-Party and Third-Party Evaluations of Social Chatbots,"This paper explores the efficacy of online versus offline evaluation methods in assessing conversational chatbots, specifically comparing first-party direct interactions with third-party observational assessments. By extending a benchmarking dataset of user dialogs with empathetic chatbots with offline third-party evaluations, we present a systematic comparison between the feedback from online interactions and the more detached offline third-party evaluations. Our results reveal that offline human evaluations fail to capture the subtleties of human-chatbot interactions as effectively as online assessments. In comparison, automated third-party evaluations using a GPT-4 model offer a better approximation of first-party human judgments given detailed instructions. This study highlights the limitations of third-party evaluations in grasping the complexities of user experiences and advocates for the integration of direct interaction feedback in conversational AI evaluation to enhance system development and user satisfaction."
Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Weighted Aggregation,"This paper introduces a new federated learning scheme that leverages over-the-air computation. A novel feature of this scheme is the proposal to employ adaptive weights during aggregation, a facet treated as predefined in other over-the-air schemes. This can mitigate the impact of wireless channel conditions on learning performance, without needing channel state information at transmitter side (CSIT). We provide a mathematical methodology to derive the convergence bound for the proposed scheme in the context of computational heterogeneity and general loss functions, supplemented with design insights. Accordingly, we propose aggregation cost metrics and efficient algorithms to find optimized weights for the aggregation. Finally, through numerical experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Even with the challenges posed by channel conditions and device heterogeneity, the proposed scheme surpasses other over-the-air strategies by an accuracy improvement of 15% over the scheme using CSIT and 30% compared to the one without CSIT."
Selling Joint Ads: A Regret Minimization Perspective,"Motivated by online retail, we consider the problem of selling one item (e.g., an ad slot) to two non-excludable buyers (say, a merchant and a brand). This problem captures, for example, situations where a merchant and a brand cooperatively bid in an auction to advertise a product, and both benefit from the ad being shown. A mechanism collects bids from the two and decides whether to allocate and which payments the two parties should make. This gives rise to intricate incentive compatibility constraints, e.g., on how to split payments between the two parties. We approach the problem of finding a revenue-maximizing incentive-compatible mechanism from an online learning perspective; this poses significant technical challenges. First, the action space (the class of all possible mechanisms) is huge; second, the function that maps mechanisms to revenue is highly irregular, ruling out standard discretization-based approaches.   In the stochastic setting, we design an efficient learning algorithm achieving a regret bound of $O(T^{3/4})$. Our approach is based on an adaptive discretization scheme of the space of mechanisms, as any non-adaptive discretization fails to achieve sublinear regret. In the adversarial setting, we exploit the non-Lipschitzness of the problem to prove a strong negative result, namely that no learning algorithm can achieve more than half of the revenue of the best fixed mechanism in hindsight. We then consider the $\sigma$-smooth adversary; we construct an efficient learning algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$ and builds on a succinct encoding of exponentially many experts. Finally, we prove that no learning algorithm can achieve less than $\Omega(\sqrt T)$ regret in both the stochastic and the smooth setting, thus narrowing the range where the minimax regret rates for these two problems lie."
More than just a Tool: People's Perception and Acceptance of Prosocial Delivery Robots as Fellow Road Users,"Service robots are increasingly deployed in public spaces, performing functional tasks such as making deliveries. To better integrate them into our social environment and enhance their adoption, we consider integrating social identities within delivery robots along with their functional identity. We conducted a virtual reality-based pilot study to explore people's perceptions and acceptance of delivery robots that perform prosocial behavior. Preliminary findings from thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews illustrate people's ambivalence about dual identity. We discussed the emerging themes in light of social identity theory, framing effect, and human-robot intergroup dynamics. Building on these insights, we propose that the next generation of delivery robots should use peer-based framing, an updated value proposition, and an interactive design that places greater emphasis on expressing intentionality and emotional responses."

Key advancements, such as the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network GELAN and Programmable Gradient Information PGI, significantly enhance feature extraction and gradient flow, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency. By incorporating Depthwise Convolutions and the lightweight C3Ghost architecture, YOLOv9 reduces computational complexity while maintaining high precision. Benchmark tests on Microsoft COCO demonstrate its superior mean Average Precision mAP and faster inference times, outperforming YOLOv8 across multiple metrics. The model versatility is highlighted by its seamless deployment across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to high performance GPUs, with built in support for PyTorch and TensorRT integration.

Approximation of the Hilbert Transform on the unit circle,"The paper deals with the numerical approximation of the Hilbert transform on the unit circle using Szeg\""o and anti-Szeg\""o quadrature formulas. These schemes exhibit maximum precision with oppositely signed errors and allow for improved accuracy through their averaged results. Their computation involves a free parameter associated with the corresponding para-orthogonal polynomials. Here, it is suitably chosen to construct a Szeg\""o and anti-Szeg\""o formula whose nodes are strategically distanced from the singularity of the Hilbert kernel. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method."
Controllable Synthetic Clinical Note Generation with Privacy Guarantees,"In the field of machine learning, domain-specific annotated data is an invaluable resource for training effective models. However, in the medical domain, this data often includes Personal Health Information (PHI), raising significant privacy concerns. The stringent regulations surrounding PHI limit the availability and sharing of medical datasets, which poses a substantial challenge for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop advanced machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to ""clone"" datasets containing PHI. Our approach ensures that the cloned datasets retain the essential characteristics and utility of the original data without compromising patient privacy. By leveraging differential-privacy techniques and a novel fine-tuning task, our method produces datasets that are free from identifiable information while preserving the statistical properties necessary for model training. We conduct utility testing to evaluate the performance of machine learning models trained on the cloned datasets. The results demonstrate that our cloned datasets not only uphold privacy standards but also enhance model performance compared to those trained on traditional anonymized datasets. This work offers a viable solution for the ethical and effective utilization of sensitive medical data in machine learning, facilitating progress in medical research and the development of robust predictive models."
FedHide: Federated Learning by Hiding in the Neighbors,"We propose a prototype-based federated learning method designed for embedding networks in classification or verification tasks. Our focus is on scenarios where each client has data from a single class. The main challenge is to develop an embedding network that can distinguish between different classes while adhering to privacy constraints. Sharing true class prototypes with the server or other clients could potentially compromise sensitive information. To tackle this issue, we propose a proxy class prototype that will be shared among clients instead of the true class prototype. Our approach generates proxy class prototypes by linearly combining them with their nearest neighbors. This technique conceals the true class prototype while enabling clients to learn discriminative embedding networks. We compare our method to alternative techniques, such as adding random Gaussian noise and using random selection with cosine similarity constraints. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of our approach against gradient inversion attacks and introduce a measure for prototype leakage. This measure quantifies the extent of private information revealed when sharing the proposed proxy class prototype. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of our approach. Our proposed method for federated learning from scratch demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2."
Detection of Electric Motor Damage Through Analysis of Sound Signals Using Bayesian Neural Networks,"Fault monitoring and diagnostics are important to ensure reliability of electric motors. Efficient algorithms for fault detection improve reliability, yet development of cost-effective and reliable classifiers for diagnostics of equipment is challenging, in particular due to unavailability of well-balanced datasets, with signals from properly functioning equipment and those from faulty equipment. Thus, we propose to use a Bayesian neural network to detect and classify faults in electric motors, given its efficacy with imbalanced training data. The performance of the proposed network is demonstrated on real life signals, and a robustness analysis of the proposed solution is provided."
SURGIVID: Annotation-Efficient Surgical Video Object Discovery,"Surgical scenes convey crucial information about the quality of surgery. Pixel-wise localization of tools and anatomical structures is the first task towards deeper surgical analysis for microscopic or endoscopic surgical views. This is typically done via fully-supervised methods which are annotation greedy and in several cases, demanding medical expertise. Considering the profusion of surgical videos obtained through standardized surgical workflows, we propose an annotation-efficient framework for the semantic segmentation of surgical scenes. We employ image-based self-supervised object discovery to identify the most salient tools and anatomical structures in surgical videos. These proposals are further refined within a minimally supervised fine-tuning step. Our unsupervised setup reinforced with only 36 annotation labels indicates comparable localization performance with fully-supervised segmentation models. Further, leveraging surgical phase labels as weak labels can better guide model attention towards surgical tools, leading to $\sim 2\%$ improvement in tool localization. Extensive ablation studies on the CaDIS dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in discovering relevant surgical objects with minimal or no supervision."

The Agent Attention module replaces large kernel convolutions, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving global context modeling. The GEFB augments feature extraction and processing capabilities, particularly in complex scenes. Extensive evaluations on COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that GateAttentionPose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, including the original UniRepLKNet, achieving superior or comparable results with improved efficiency.

Quaternion Nuclear Norm minus Frobenius Norm Minimization for color image reconstruction,"Color image restoration methods typically represent images as vectors in Euclidean space or combinations of three monochrome channels. However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results."
In-Situ Fine-Tuning of Wildlife Models in IoT-Enabled Camera Traps for Efficient Adaptation,"Wildlife monitoring via camera traps has become an essential tool in ecology, but the deployment of machine learning models for on-device animal classification faces significant challenges due to domain shifts and resource constraints. This paper introduces WildFit, a novel approach that reconciles the conflicting goals of achieving high domain generalization performance and ensuring efficient inference for camera trap applications. WildFit leverages continuous background-aware model fine-tuning to deploy ML models tailored to the current location and time window, allowing it to maintain robust classification accuracy in the new environment without requiring significant computational resources. This is achieved by background-aware data synthesis, which generates training images representing the new domain by blending background images with animal images from the source domain. We further enhance fine-tuning effectiveness through background drift detection and class distribution drift detection, which optimize the quality of synthesized data and improve generalization performance. Our extensive evaluation across multiple camera trap datasets demonstrates that WildFit achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches."
Efficient Learning of Balanced Signed Graphs via Iterative Linear Programming,"Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights, encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced signed graph has no cycles of odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map simply to ones in a similarity-transformed positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of well-studied spectral filters designed for positive graphs. We propose a fast method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, for each node $i$, to determine its polarity $\beta_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and edge weights $\{w_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^N$, we extend a sparse inverse covariance formulation based on linear programming (LP) called CLIME, by adding linear constraints to enforce ``consistent"" signs of edge weights $\{w_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^N$ with the polarities of connected nodes -- i.e., positive/negative edges connect nodes of same/opposing polarities. For each LP, we adapt projections on convex set (POCS) to determine a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho > 0$ that guarantees LP feasibility. We solve the resulting LP via an off-the-shelf LP solver in $\mathcal{O}(N^{2.055})$. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables the use of spectral filters and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) designed for positive graphs on signed graphs."
Lagrange Duality and Compound Multi-Attention Transformer for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation, a critical application of semantic segmentation in healthcare, has seen significant advancements through specialized computer vision techniques. While deep learning-based medical image segmentation is essential for assisting in medical diagnosis, the lack of diverse training data causes the long-tail problem. Moreover, most previous hybrid CNN-ViT architectures have limited ability to combine various attentions in different layers of the Convolutional Neural Network. To address these issues, we propose a Lagrange Duality Consistency (LDC) Loss, integrated with Boundary-Aware Contrastive Loss, as the overall training objective for semi-supervised learning to mitigate the long-tail problem. Additionally, we introduce CMAformer, a novel network that synergizes the strengths of ResUNet and Transformer. The cross-attention block in CMAformer effectively integrates spatial attention and channel attention for multi-scale feature fusion. Overall, our results indicate that CMAformer, combined with the feature fusion framework and the new consistency loss, demonstrates strong complementarity in semi-supervised learning ensembles. We achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple public medical image datasets. Example code are available at: \url{https://github.com/lzeeorno/Lagrange-Duality-and-CMAformer}."
Full-text Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Model,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website."
Stable Language Model Pre-training by Reducing Embedding Variability,"Stable pre-training is essential for achieving better-performing language models. However, tracking pre-training stability by calculating gradient variance at every step is impractical due to the significant computational costs. We explore Token Embedding Variability (TEV) as a simple and efficient proxy for assessing pre-training stability in language models with pre-layer normalization, given that shallower layers are more prone to gradient explosion (section 2.2). Moreover, we propose Multi-head Low-Rank Attention (MLRA) as an architecture to alleviate such instability by limiting the exponential growth of output embedding variance, thereby preventing the gradient explosion (section 3.2). Empirical results on GPT-2 with MLRA demonstrate increased stability and lower perplexity, particularly in deeper models."
XMOL: Explainable Multi-property Optimization of Molecules,"Molecular optimization is a key challenge in drug discovery and material science domain, involving the design of molecules with desired properties. Existing methods focus predominantly on single-property optimization, necessitating repetitive runs to target multiple properties, which is inefficient and computationally expensive. Moreover, these methods often lack transparency, making it difficult for researchers to understand and control the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Explainable Multi-property Optimization of Molecules (XMOL), to optimize multiple molecular properties simultaneously while incorporating explainability. Our approach builds on state-of-the-art geometric diffusion models, extending them to multi-property optimization through the introduction of spectral normalization and enhanced molecular constraints for stabilized training. Additionally, we integrate interpretive and explainable techniques throughout the optimization process. We evaluated XMOL on the real-world molecular datasets i.e., QM9, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single property and multiple properties optimization while offering interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and reliable molecular design."
Critical link identification of power system vulnerability based on modified graph attention network,"With the expansion of the power grid and the increase of the proportion of new energy sources, the uncertainty and random factors of the power grid increase, endangering the safe operation of the system. It is particularly important to find out the critical links of vulnerability in the power grid to ensure the reliability of the power grid operation. Aiming at the problem that the identification speed of the traditional critical link of vulnerability identification methods is slow and difficult to meet the actual operation requirements of the power grid, the improved graph attention network (IGAT) based identification method of the critical link is proposed. First, the evaluation index set is established by combining the complex network theory and the actual operation data of power grid. Secondly, IGAT is used to dig out the mapping relationship between various indicators and critical links of vulnerability during the operation of the power grid, establish the identification model of critical links of vulnerability, and optimize the original graph attention network considering the training accuracy and efficiency. Thirdly, the original data set is obtained through simulation, and the identification model is trained, verified and tested. Finally, the model is applied to the improved IEEE 30-node system and the actual power grid, and the results show that the proposed method is feasible, and the accuracy and speed are better than that of traditional methods. It has certain engineering utilization value."
Supporting Online Discussions: Integrating AI Into the adhocracy+ Participation Platform To Enhance Deliberation,"Online spaces allow people to discuss important issues and make joint decisions, regardless of their location or time zone. However, without proper support and thoughtful design, these discussions often lack structure and politeness during the exchanges of opinions. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents an opportunity to support both participants and organizers of large-scale online participation processes. In this paper, we present an extension of adhocracy+, a large-scale open source participation platform, that provides two additional debate modules that are supported by AI to enhance the discussion quality and participant interaction."
ASSNet: Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Network for Microtumors and Multi-Organ Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation, a crucial task in computer vision, facilitates the automated delineation of anatomical structures and pathologies, supporting clinicians in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Notably, transformers employing shifted window-based self-attention have demonstrated exceptional performance. However, their reliance on local window attention limits the fusion of local and global contextual information, crucial for segmenting microtumors and miniature organs. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Network (ASSNet), a transformer architecture that effectively integrates local and global features for precise medical image segmentation. ASSNet comprises a transformer-based U-shaped encoder-decoder network. The encoder utilizes shifted window self-attention across five resolutions to extract multi-scale features, which are then propagated to the decoder through skip connections. We introduce an augmented multi-layer perceptron within the encoder to explicitly model long-range dependencies during feature extraction. Recognizing the constraints of conventional symmetrical encoder-decoder designs, we propose an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) decoder to complement our encoder. This decoder incorporates three key components: the Long Range Dependencies (LRD) block, the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, and the Adaptive Semantic Center (ASC) block. These components synergistically facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale features extracted by the decoder while capturing long-range dependencies and refining object boundaries. Comprehensive experiments on diverse medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, demonstrate that ASSNet achieves state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at: \url{https://github.com/lzeeorno/ASSNet}."
Bounds on Covert Capacity in the Sub-Exponential Slotted Asynchronous Regime,"We develop tight bounds for the covert capacity of slotted asynchronous binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, in which a codeword is transmitted in one of several slots with known boundaries, where the number of slots is sub-exponential in the codeword length. Our upper and lower bounds are within a multiplicative factor of $\sqrt{2}$ independent of the channel. This result partially fills a characterization gap between the covert capacity without asynchronism and the covert capacity with exponential asynchronism. Our key technical contributions consist of i) a tight upper bound for the relative entropy characterizing the effect of asynchronism on the covertness constraint in our achievability proof; ii) a careful converse analysis to characterize the maximum allowable weight or power of codewords to meet the covertness constraint. Our results suggest that, unlike the case without asynchronism, the choice of covertness metric does not change the covert capacity in the presence of asynchronism."
Training Spiking Neural Networks via Augmented Direct Feedback Alignment,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs), the models inspired by the mechanisms of real neurons in the brain, transmit and represent information by employing discrete action potentials or spikes. The sparse, asynchronous properties of information processing make SNNs highly energy efficient, leading to SNNs being promising solutions for implementing neural networks in neuromorphic devices. However, the nondifferentiable nature of SNN neurons makes it a challenge to train them. The current training methods of SNNs that are based on error backpropagation (BP) and precisely designing surrogate gradient are difficult to implement and biologically implausible, hindering the implementation of SNNs on neuromorphic devices. Thus, it is important to train SNNs with a method that is both physically implementatable and biologically plausible. In this paper, we propose using augmented direct feedback alignment (aDFA), a gradient-free approach based on random projection, to train SNNs. This method requires only partial information of the forward process during training, so it is easy to implement and biologically plausible. We systematically demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed aDFA-SNNs scheme, propose its effective working range, and analyze its well-performing settings by employing genetic algorithm. We also analyze the impact of crucial features of SNNs on the scheme, thus demonstrating its superiority and stability over BP and conventional direct feedback alignment. Our scheme can achieve competitive performance without accurate prior knowledge about the utilized system, thus providing a valuable reference for physically training SNNs."
A Spatiotemporal Stealthy Backdoor Attack against Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform abnormal actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing proposed backdoors suffer from several issues, e.g., fixed visual trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack against c-MADRL, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the attack duration. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of injected backdoors. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoored agent via reward reverse and unilateral guidance during training to ensure its adverse influence on the entire team. We evaluate our backdoor attacks on two classic c-MADRL algorithms VDN and QMIX, in a popular c-MADRL environment SMAC. The experimental results demonstrate that our backdoor attacks are able to reach a high attack success rate (91.6\%) while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate (3.7\%)."
